            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Be≈øides, if they had been but managed as the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Seamen were in former days, and as the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> do at this day, to ≈øave near half their money, and mo≈øt of their Seamens Lives. But I ≈øay, Your Honours being now al≈øo Re≈øolved to ≈øtudy their Relief, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume, in all Humility, to ca≈øt in my Mite al≈øo. Now, in order to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55757:3"/>≈øame, which I would intreat your Honours to accept of, as Rough and Unframed Timber, to be ≈øquared and fitted to what part your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours plea≈øe; and one thing is, many crooked pieces are made u≈øe of in the building of Shipping, that when placed aright not only ≈øerve to ≈øtrengthen the Ship, and help to pre≈øerve the Lives of the Seamen, but formally u≈øe to help tohold the Ships together, while they daily beat their Enemies; and tho the≈øe Pieces may not be always ≈øo readily known to all Landmen, I will pre≈øume ≈øome may ≈øerve now, and ≈øome another time.</p>
            <p>And I do a≈ø≈øure your Honours, if I had better at hand, I would pre≈øent them to you: But they are my own, and ≈øo ≈øaved me the trouble of begging, borrowing, or which is wor≈øe, ≈øtealing; and I intreat your Honours Patience; for their Mi≈øeries being ≈øo dreadful, and ≈øo many years a growing, and ≈øo many times Ten Thou≈øands, as they could not have been ea≈øily repre≈øented, except one ≈øhould have ≈øaid, their Ca≈øe was almo≈øt all together Mi≈øerable: But ble≈ø≈øed be God that it is not: They have a good King and good Countrey for their Friends, if their Ca≈øes are not blinded from them: And as to their Remedies, it requires a great deal of Care and Inquiry: And when I look back to what I repre≈øented before; and forward, to what ≈øtrange need there is of them now, and when I hear that a great many there is that are in Droves, travelling in other Countries without Shooes or Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ≈øeeking to enter into the Service of the Merchants of <hi>England</hi> there, or to ≈øerve other Nations, and Run away from che Merchant-Ships al≈øo, and lo≈øe their Pay, ≈øome of them not being willing to come home, for fear of the Pre≈øs; This makes my Heart dread the Effects of it, and do ≈øuppo≈øe the≈øe Two Things would be worth while to be inquired into by the Parliament, to know how the Ca≈øe ≈øtands with them in the≈øe re≈øpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Let every Man of War's Book, that hath been in the <hi>Streights,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> be ≈øearched, to ≈øee what Numbers Run away out of any Ship, or every Ship, at any Port or Place.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> To have an Account of the Men of War and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Ships lo≈øt this Eighteen Months to the <hi>French,</hi> with the whole Number of Men taken in each Ship, and in the whole Shipping lo≈øt; and then have al≈øo the Number of Men return'd from <hi>France</hi> in that time, that did belong to tho≈øe Ships, and what is wanting may be ≈øuppo≈øed to be entred into the <hi>French</hi> Service, if not dead; and if
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55757:3"/>of the <hi>Ea≈øt-India</hi> Ships taken, there be come home ≈øhort, near an Hundred of tho≈øe men that were taken; it is to be fear'd, the re≈øt will ≈øtay until warm weather, and then get ≈øome Money and Cloaths, if our Pre≈øs is ≈øo great this Winter, that they meet the poor Captive Wretches when they Return home in their Lou≈øie Cloaths from <hi>France,</hi> and beg their way near an Hundred and Fifty Miles; then before they come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> catch them, and carry them on Board, Rags and Lice, as they Run; put them down in the Hold of the Ve≈ø≈øel, to lie on the Boards or Balla≈øt, or what they plea≈øe, if they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bedding; and as Queen <hi>E≈øther</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>if they peri≈øh, they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Notable Age to tame Prodigals in, if they be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Seamen; but if they be Double-Pay Officers, then it may be they Run up and down, and be as bad or wor≈øe than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ≈øo it may be will not be worth, ≈øome of them, a Groat a Dozen, when the War is over; tho they mo≈øt times Live; For the Officers that have Liberty to come on Shore, die very few of them. But this by the way. But I am too large in the Introduction.</p>
            <p>I did think to ≈øay ≈øomething more as to the Seamen's Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, in this Preface; as that without the Seamen be paid off yearly on Shore, and have a Fortnight's or Month's Liberty to Recruit their Healths, I am afraid they will never be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to come into the Service, neither ≈øtay there; and if they do, and die, it is as bad as Running; for if they Run away in <hi>England,</hi> and the Merchants get them, it is an help to Trade, and the King may have them again; and I could never know the Rea≈øon of that pretence of keeping the Seamen in ≈øuch ≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in their payments, in this Age more than any other, to be paid on Board; as if his Maje≈øty's Service was not as good as in any Age of the World. For my part, I ≈øay, according to the money rai≈øed, there could never have been better Pay for the Seamen in the world. And indeed I would not have the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>England</hi> ≈øay Ju≈øtly, That God and the King ≈øent good Meat, but the Devil ≈øent them Cooks that ≈øpoil'd it half in dre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55757:4"/>
            <p>But in ≈øhort, I cannot ≈øee how the Nation, in the general, can an≈øwer the Seamen's being left to Ruin:</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> as I ≈øaid, it is again≈øt Grace, again≈øt the gracious Law of Chri≈øt, not to do to them as we would others ≈øhould do to us; which is taught the Children in their Catechi≈øms.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is again≈øt the gracious Providence of God to the≈øe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who did, by a Miracle, ≈øend over our gracious King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> to be a means to ≈øecure our Religion, Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties; and if the Nation, who enjoys all the≈øe in Peace at home, ≈øhould let the Seamen be Ruined, and lo≈øe all together, and their Lives into the bargain; I am afraid Chri≈øt will tell us another word in our Ears, That the Scripture ≈øhall not fail; and the ≈øame mea≈øure men mete, ≈øhall be meted to them again.</p>
            <p>And ≈øo much to their being managed contrary to Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Contrary to Rea≈øon; for Rea≈øon tells us, other Ages en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged their Seamen, and paid them on Shore; and other Nations do ≈øo now. And Rea≈øon may tell tho≈øe who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood the Nature of the paying on Board, That the Seamen's Families and Relations have not enjoyed the Benefit of little more than half their Pay, to their Familie's Comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is contrary to common ≈øen≈øe, to think that if Seamen do u≈øually die, great part, where they are kept 2 or 3 years on board, that they ≈øhould have any Policy to keep them until they die, rather than to pay them off, to Recruit their Health and Lives.</p>
            <p>And indeed, who could be ever imagined to come freely into that Service where nothing but Death can part again, and then the Widow denied their Mony oft-times at la≈øt. And be≈øides the Lo≈øs of the Seamen's Lives, there is extraordinary Charge to the Nation, and no benefit to the publick; but it may be the Commanders that had abu≈øed the Seamen all the War, could not get more, and would want a Ship to get Mony in, and ≈øo might want bread, while our brave Commanders would have Men enough But tho≈øe who have driven away the Seamen from their Ships, and could have a ≈øupply by turning over men from other Ships, the≈øe might be at a Lo≈øs for Men next Year. But my Skill in Sea Affairs is too ≈ømall: Did it but attain to the heighth of my Faithulne≈øs to his Maje≈øty, and Love to my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, I would, if the Lord a≈ø≈øi≈øted me with Life and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55757:4"/>Health, write ≈øuch an Hi≈øtory of the Knavery, Folly, Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, Treachery, Ruin and De≈øtruction of this War; in the Sea-Affairs, the Land would admire at; and would write eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Line, to the be≈øt of my Judgment, what would be found true, not only in another Age, where they will ≈øpeak plainly, how his Maje≈øty, and the Parliament, and Nation, and Merchants are cheated and abu≈øed. But I would write what I believe will be found true in the Day of Judgment, where all Cloaks will be thrown off; and then it will be known, that God did not ≈øend Mankind into the world to be like Fi≈øhes, the great ones to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the little ones; and I ble≈øs the Lord, who kept me from being one of the Devourers of the Age; for I have had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with ea≈øe to be a Mon≈øter, when I laid out an hundred Pound a week, or two, in Seamen's Pay, if I had bought at half Profit, or Twelve Shillings in the Pound Profit, as ≈øome Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters did, I ≈øhould have doubled my Mony ≈øo often, to have been able to have ≈øwallowed up 3 or 4 Seamen's Pay for a Breakfa≈øt, be≈øides what <hi>I</hi> had for Dinner and Supper; and then <hi>I</hi> ≈øhould never have ≈øaid a word of the Ruin of the Seamen, but ≈øhould have been forc'd to have kept all Coun≈øel, if the King had been cheated of a quarter of his Money, and the Seamen of above half their pay.</p>
            <p>But I pre≈øume it will be well to look back to the mo≈øt happy ≈øtate of our Ships of War, when we did mo≈øt effectually beat our Enemies, and incourage our Seamen, and ≈øee if we do not find the neglect of their method hath been the Lo≈øs of half our Seamen, and many of our Ships.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether their way was not to go out in the Summer, and take all Opportunities to ≈øight and de≈øtroy their Enemies, and come in again with the <hi>greate≈øt part of the Fleet,</hi> and pay off <hi>the Seamen,</hi> and ≈øave <hi>their Lives and Pay.</hi>

            <p>Whether if this had been done, the Seamen would not have been incouraged to <hi>come freely into the King's Service,</hi> as in other Ages, as into a place where there was Mony, and Liberty, and Relea≈øe, and not perpetual Bondage. And if at la≈øt di≈øcharged by rea≈øon of Sickne≈øs, and had Tickets ≈øigned by all the ≈øigning Officers, for the ≈øame to be deprived, otherwi≈øe cheated publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their mony, to the ≈øhame of the Pay, and the Ruin of the di≈øcharged; and whether any can now, on the la≈øt Terms,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55757:5"/>be ≈øafe to ≈øerve their King and Country: and it may be que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether it be not a ≈øhameful thing, when poor Seamen have had their Pay received by fal≈øe Powers, they ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the ≈øight of the Ship's Books, to ≈øee who received it; and therefore whether al≈øo this, and the denying them otherwi≈øe the knowledg of their Ca≈øe, be not an unju≈øt and unrea≈øonable thing to let poor Creatures be Cheated and Ruined, and hide it from them. And what advantage it is to the Government, to let their poor Seamen be ≈øo managed, be≈øides the King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at extraordinary Charge to pay them ≈øo far from <hi>London,</hi> and the City deprived of the benefit of taking their mony, as in other Ages, wherein the City of <hi>London</hi> was not u≈øed to be ≈øo ≈ølighted, neither the Seamen ≈øo Ruined.</p>
            <p>But I ≈øhall pre≈øume to ≈øay more in the Body of my Book; for whoever plea≈øeth to read it at their lei≈øure, what my Thoughts are; and if the Honourable Hou≈øes pardon me, I ≈øhall not need much to trouble my ≈øelf with the Offences any others may take at it; for I write for good, and not to plea≈øe, but to hinder Cheating the King, and Ruining the Seamen; and not to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tho≈øe that would have it all ≈ømuggled up in ≈øilence; which makes me think of one lately, that becau≈øe he could not find any thing fal≈øe in my book, had this ≈øuppo≈øition, and that was, That he ≈øuppo≈øed if I had Repre≈øented ≈øo much in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King would have hanged me.</p>
            <p>Now to that, being only a Suppo≈øition, I will an≈øwer it with other Suppo≈øitions: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I mu≈øt have been a Fool or a Knave to have writ it, if I did not con≈øult before I writ it, whether I could, with a good Con≈øcience, have ≈øuffered Death for the ≈øame; and if I could, that might have been an ea≈øier Death than the Stone or the Gout. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ≈øuppo≈øe, by his Leave, if the <hi>French</hi> King's Subjects are Ruined and De≈øtroyed, it is by his Knowledge and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and not Ruined and de≈øtroyed without his knowledge, and the knowledge of his Nobles, as I pre≈øume our Seamen's Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are hid from the King and Parliament, and the blame mu≈øt at la≈øt lie ≈øomewhere; and it may be the next Age will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at ≈øhe Hi≈øtory of it; therefore I take pains to inform the King and Parliament, that they may let the blame and ≈øhame be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55757:5"/>laid on tho≈øe who have been Unju≈øt, and Cruel, and Barbarous in the management of the Ruined Seamen and their Families: And indeed I ≈øuppo≈øe al≈øo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the <hi>French</hi> King, tho he plagues almo≈øt all Mankind, yet he incourages his Seamen, let's them come on ≈øhore every Year, and mony in their Pocket; lends them his Men of War to Privateer in, gives them his Tenths; and in ≈øhort, if they have gotten Three Millions of Riches this Year from us, his Seamen's Share is more Hundreds of Thou≈øands of Pounds than would pay our Ruined Seamen all their Q's and R's.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>I</hi> ≈øuppo≈øe if he had ≈øeen his Seamen had been half dead, or frightned away, or Cheated of their Pay, and he not known it before-hand, <hi>I</hi> prote≈øt <hi>I</hi> do not only ≈øuppo≈øe, but really conclude they would have been more likely to have hang'd ≈øome that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined his Seamen, for being Knaves to do it; and tho≈øe that ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hone≈øt, for being Tools to con≈øent to it; and that might have e≈øcaped well next time, or at lea≈øt had as good Quarter for telling as they for acting.</p>
            <p>And ≈øuppo≈øe one Suppo≈øition more, That if the <hi>French</hi> King did know that his Admiralty, and Navy-Board, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of Ships did Ruin and de≈øtroy his Seamen's Lives and Pay, the Seamen would not ≈øo con≈øtantly go home to <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as they do; neither would he have Men enough to man his Fleet; neither would any other means ≈øecure his Seamen's Lives and Pay, without Managers that were as merciful to them as good men are to their Bea≈øts, who do not let them groan and cry, and langui≈øh away for want of that Provender that is due to them for their Labour, for that day's work wherein they fell ≈øick under their Burden, which is too ≈øad, and too tedious to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large on.</p>
            <p>And if your Honours think it to be too tedious, it may be con≈øidered, That the Mi≈øeries of the Seamen in <hi>England,</hi> have been of more various Kinds, and peradventure various Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers than the Mi≈øeries of all the Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> and cannot be Repre≈øented in a few Words; be≈øides all their other Mi≈øeries of their Families that they are ≈øubject to, equal with the lo≈øt of Mankind; And as their Di≈øea≈øes are many, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire hone≈øt faithful Doctors, in order to their Cure, and not leave them in the hands of hard hearted Wretches, to Ruin
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55757:6"/>them. But <hi>I</hi> could write until <hi>I</hi> tire your Honours and my ≈øelf. But <hi>I</hi> beg your Honour's Gracious Pardon, and do lay my ≈øelf at your Honour's Feet, and beg of God to give his Maje≈øty Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as an Angel of God; and that God would fill your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with all Wi≈ødom, and that in his and your Pro≈øperity the Nation may be happy and ble≈ø≈øed; and then <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> ≈øhall in mercy injoy a ≈øhare of the ≈øame; Who ≈øub≈øcribe my ≈øelf a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lover and Servant to his mo≈øt Gracious Maje≈øty King <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and all your Honours, and all good men, while <hi>I</hi> remain,</p>

            <p>THE Subject of Encouraging and Increa≈øing of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh</hi> Seamen, is of greater Con≈øequence than abundance of Mankind doth readily apprehend; and we being an <hi>I≈øland,</hi> cannot be ≈øafe or happy in Peace or War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; which makes me admire what ≈øen≈øle≈øs Stuff the Brains of tho≈øe are, or what hardened metal their Hearts are, that have ≈øo greatly Ruined and Oppre≈ø≈øed many of them and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; and <hi>I</hi> have admired and lamented with Tears, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand their Ruin: And if God him≈øelf commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> ≈øo ≈øtrictly, <hi>That if they ≈øaw their Enemie's Ox or A≈øs fall down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Burden, they ≈øhould help them up;</hi> Then God forbid I ≈øhould have my Heart harder than a <hi>Jew,</hi> that when I ≈øee not my Enemie's A≈ø≈øes, but my mo≈øt gracious Soveraign King <hi>William's,</hi> and my dear Country's Seamen, many dead under their burdens, and others in Ditches of mi≈øery, if I ≈øhould not endeavour to help them up, I ≈øhould be wor≈øe than a <hi>Jew.</hi> And I con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ≈øeeing their mi≈øeries thrown on them, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øome Years to help them out, until I did almo≈øt fall in my ≈øelf, <hi>I</hi> cried out for help to their Ma≈øter and Dame, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ≈øent a large ≈øupply of Mony to their Managers and Drivers, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them and help them up; and at fir≈øt they had help. But the poor Cattle being kept travelling ≈øo long, until they fell ≈øick by Droves; and when they that drove them ≈øaw they were ≈øick, and could be drove no farther, either let them die with the Load on their backs, but if others let them out to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55757:7"/>Pa≈øture, then there was an Order, That if they could not be well, to come into the ≈øame Drove in 28 Days, they mu≈øt then run the hazard to lo≈øe all the Hay and Corn due to them and their Young; altho it may be many of them died within a few Days after they were in Pa≈øture; or it may be the Drove, they belonged to, was gone 300 miles before they were well; and it may be they went into the next Drove of their Ma≈øters they met with, if they lived, and were well; or it may be they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øick, and were ≈øent into ≈øome Stable for Cure, and there did continue long after their Drivers had ruined the Re≈øt of their Fother: And I con≈øidering what a Scarcity of others to bear the Burdens, and ≈øo Extraordinary Charge to buy more, that I thought it better to keep them there was, and prevent that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and Charge, e≈øpecially con≈øidering be≈øides, That it was a ≈øign of mens being wicked, who≈øe tender mercies were cruel; And al≈øo, that the young ones they bought, did many times die before they were a Year u≈øed to the Pack-Saddle.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, I dreamed, That without there were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt, faithful Managers, Drivers and Ho≈øtlers, the poor Cattle would be ruined at la≈øt.</p>
            <p>But I had need to beg pardon for telling ≈øo much of my Dream: <hi>I</hi> will forbear the re≈øt; for perhaps it would be an hour longer, and they that under≈øtand the interpretation, find it all true.</p>
            <p>But now for the Seamen's Encouragement to ≈øerve his Maje≈øty, <hi>I</hi> will propo≈øe ≈øome few things, always provided, That if <hi>I</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe ≈øuch and ≈øuch hone≈øt ways and means, it may not be mi≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood: As for Example, if <hi>I</hi> ≈øay, that there mu≈øt be good Commanders, and hone≈øt Pur≈øers, or they will be mi≈øerable at la≈øt, and run away indeed, many of them. This mu≈øt not be under≈øtood as if <hi>I</hi> were ≈øo uncharitable as to reflect on all in tho≈øe Places; for we have ≈øome Worthy Admirals and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who≈øe Names <hi>I</hi> honour, and who will neither abu≈øe the Seamen them≈øelves, neither ≈øuffer their Officers to abu≈øe them; and for every hone≈øt Pur≈øer <hi>I</hi> love them.</p>
            <p>But my Head being ≈øo like a Land-Flood, over-flowing with the la≈øt Stormy Times of Mi≈øery and Knavery, that ≈øome of it will overflow the Banks before <hi>I</hi> can get any Materials ready to ≈øecure the Country from a further inundation.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55757:7"/>
            <p>And now <hi>I</hi> will begin to propo≈øe ≈øome Materials that <hi>I</hi> do ≈øuppo≈øe will be u≈øeful, in order for ≈øecurity for time to come; and that which is u≈øeful may be made u≈øe of now or hereafter, as Times mend: How long they have been bad, God knows. But <hi>I</hi> remember, many Years pa≈øt, it was ≈øaid, <hi>Bad Men made Bad Times:</hi> how it is now, mu≈øt be left to the Learned to Judge. And it was ≈øaid, <hi>Bad Times cau≈øed Good Laws;</hi> God ≈øend the Seamen ≈øome Token of the Truth of that before they are all ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined.</p>
            <p>And now as to the fir≈øt Con≈øideration of the Seamen's Relief, it is to be con≈øidered of the Admiralty and Navy-Board: if they be the mo≈øt Excellent Men in <hi>England</hi> for Loyalty to his pre≈øent Maje≈øty, and Care of his Men of War and Merchant-Ships, and to pre≈øerve the Seamen's Lives and Pay, that will, it may be, be half a Cure. But if ever there ≈øhould be in <hi>England,</hi> for time to come, an Admiralty and Navy-board that ≈øhould be one part fal≈øe and Treacherous, and the other ≈øoft, and ea≈øy, and fooli≈øh, to be led into ignorance and madne≈øs, it might perhaps lie in their power to put in ≈øeveral Cowardly, Sorry, Damming Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that would Ruin and Drive away Thou≈øands of Seamen, and never fight One Enemy; and if there were abundance of good Commanders and Officers that loved the Seamen, and would fight their Enemies, and protect their Friends, they might be tied up as ≈øo many Cats, ≈øome in one Room, and ≈øome in another; and the Mice might play up and down in all the re≈øt of the Rooms, and al≈øo devour half the Victuals and Cloaths in ≈øome Rooms, and be never hurt hardly; Or indeed, in plain <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> there might be Ships of War have Orders to lie in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and their Enemie's Ships might come within TwoLeagues of them, and it may be ≈ønatch away a Merchant-man, and be gone: And if the others ≈øay, <hi>Their Orders is to lie there, and they mu≈øt not break their Orders;</hi> that may ≈øerve; or if there ≈øhould be a Spuadron ordered to lie before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to keep their Ships from coming out, and the <hi>French</hi> did ≈øtart out, and ours had no Orders to follow them, then it may be they might take ≈øome more <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia</hi> Ships; I think they took Four <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia</hi> Ships la≈øt time, the next day, as near as I can remember; And I deal plainly, becau≈øe I write not either for Profit, Prai≈øe, or Preferment; and ≈øo would do as a Lawyer or Phy≈øician, that giveth Law or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55757:8"/>to a Friend freely, giveth the be≈øt Advice and Help they can po≈ø≈øible, to have done the ≈øooner, and perfect the Cure ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</p>
            <p>And now having ≈øaid, it may be, too much to the fir≈øt, <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, only ob≈øerving, by the way, how it is po≈ø≈øible we Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>London</hi> may be ≈øerved when we put our Children to Nur≈øe; We may pay the be≈øt prices in the World to the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and if they be not hone≈øt, the Children may be ≈øtarved at la≈øt, if we do not go, or ≈øend to ≈øee how they are u≈øed; and if there be good Milk provided for them, it may fall out, that the Nur≈øe, or her Children, or Servant, yea the very Mongril Dog of the Hou≈øe may devour it three quarters up, with as much greedine≈øs as ever a Ticket-Buyer bought a Seaman's Pay, Seven Pound Ten Shillings for Forty Shillings, and as much hone≈øty as ever a poor Seaman was made Run ba≈øely and ≈øhamefully out of his Pay at the Office, or at Pay-day.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore if the Seamen ≈øhould, or would be ever encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, we ≈øhould look back to the Ju≈øtice, Policy and Hone≈øty of our Fore-fathers, who u≈øed to pay their Seamen their Mony on Shore; and the Commanders, and Seamen, and Ships, u≈øed to be agreed together to fight and Ruin, and de≈øtroy their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Sea; and God ble≈ø≈øed their hone≈øt Courage, and their hone≈øt Pay; and every Seaman's Life then lo≈øt at Sea, was as a Poy≈øonous Arrow to their Enemies: They kill'd their Enemies, and de≈øtroy'd their Fleets and Seamen; and they that lived came in and were paid; and tho≈øe that died, had their money, paid their Friends, and Bounty-money ≈øometimes al≈øo; and this did bu≈øine≈øs.</p>
            <p>And there is the≈øe Two Things to be con≈øidered of, which of them ≈øhewed mo≈øt Courage, mo≈øt Policy, mo≈øt Profit or mo≈øt Lo≈øs, our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Fleet neglecting or refu≈øing to fall upon the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, when God from Heaven turned the Wind fair for our Fleet to fall on the <hi>French,</hi> when they were in <hi>Fre≈øh-Water-Bay,</hi> on our own Coa≈øt; When, in all likelihood, God that gave us the Wind to fall on them, would have given us the Victory, and then we might have Ruined their Fleet on our own Coa≈øt, if we had fought as our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Ships u≈øed to do when <hi>I</hi> was a Boy, and it may be not lo≈øt 4 Ships, neither Two Thou≈øand Seamen in the Fight, becau≈øe God ≈øeemed to turn the Wind for our Fleet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55757:8"/>to fight, as he did for our gracious King <hi>William</hi> to Land at fir≈øt, and Crowned his Indu≈øtry and Courage: And whether if our mo≈øt Gracious and Valiant King <hi>William</hi> had been afraid to have fallen on his Enemies at the <hi>Boyn,</hi> becau≈øe of danger to have ≈øaved ≈øome hundred Men's Lives, then he might not have lo≈øt the Victory, and had forty Thou≈øand Men's Lives dwindled away by Sickne≈øs and Skambling Fights in <hi>Ireland</hi> ≈øince, and it may be, the War continued there until this day, as it doth at Sea; but ble≈ø≈øed be God, who gave him Courage and Victory, and to every Man he lo≈øt there, he Ruined ten Enemies, and Ruined their whole Cau≈øe in the Conclu≈øion in that Nation; and had our Fleet done ≈øo, what Mercy had <hi>England</hi> enjoyed, to have ≈øeen the <hi>French</hi> Fleet Ruined.</p>
            <p>But now as to our Ships and Men, and the two Que≈øtions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Whether it was greater Profit to the Nation and Seamen to ≈øave their Ships and Men, as afore≈øaid, and of loo≈øing four Ships, than in Fighting our Enemies Yard-Arm, and Yard-Arm, with all our Fleet, after the old <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> way of Fighting, as old <hi>Blake,</hi> and old <hi>Dean,</hi> and old <hi>Albemarle</hi> u≈øed to do, if their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were twice their Number. But now in≈øtead of that, we ≈øaved our Ships and Men then, and lo≈øt twenty times four Ships ≈øince, and twenty times two thou≈øand Seamen ≈øince, and great part of them de≈øtroyed not their Enemies by the Bargain; and which is be≈øt or wor≈øt I leave to tho≈øe who have more Skill than I to Judge. But in ≈øhort, if the Seamen of <hi>England</hi> be ever truly incouraged and pre≈øerved for time to come, they mu≈øt be paid on Shore, and it mu≈øt be ≈øo contrived as near as po≈ø≈øible, that every Man may be paid off once in a Year, or tw<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øt, and have then a little ≈øecurity again≈øt the Pre≈øs, that they may Recruit their Healths, and then they will be incouraged to come into the Service again, and their Friends glad to ≈øend them; and without that, I am afraid other incouragements will be but like a few Oats ≈øhewed a Hor≈øe to tempt him to come and take up a Pack, who remembers the la≈øt time he could never get it off before he fell ≈øick, and was thrown in the Hedg: And la≈øtly, although he ≈øaw a great part of his Companions Dyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55757:9"/>their Burdens, none would be ≈øo merciful to them as to give them a Fortnight's Re≈øt in ≈øeveral Years. This may ≈øeem a fooli≈øh Compari≈øon, but Children and Fools are ≈øaid to tell truth. and ≈øo much to that, if there be no certain time when Seamen ≈øhall be di≈øcharged, I fear there will be no certainty of their coming in for time to come freely: And ≈øo much to that.</p>
            <p>3ly, If His Maje≈øty, and the two mo≈øt Honourable Hou≈øes would advance all able Seamen's Pay four or five Shillings the Month, this might be the way to incourage the Seamen of <hi>England</hi> to ≈øerve more chearfully and freely.</p>
            <p>4thly, All ordinary Seamen's Pay, but two Shillings the Month, that they might all ≈øtrive to be Able Seamen.</p>
            <p>5thly, That all Apprenti≈øes might be incouraged when they are Hone≈øt, and Puni≈øhed when they are not; that is, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters to have twelve Shillings the Month, and they them≈øelves the remainder; that is, if they are ≈øuch as de≈øerve but Eighteen Shillings the Month, to have Four Shillings them≈øelves to buy them Cloaths; if Men, to be Paid Nine Shillings; and if an Able Seaman, to be Paid the Remainder of the Pay, as Able Seamen are; and this I Propo≈øe. becau≈øe I have known ≈øeveral Apprenti≈øes ≈øhifting, and running to and fro from Ships, have Beggered their Ma≈øters and Dames, and the King lo≈øeth their Service at la≈øt, it may be, as their Ma≈øters and Dames do their Pay. But if they had Encouragement them≈øelves, it may be they would ≈øtay in their Ships; and if they did not, to be liable to ≈øerve their Time over again, or pay for it; and al≈øo by this means it would be certain who ≈øhould have their Pay; and that hath not been this War; Sometimes the Prentices ≈øhall have all, and the Ma≈øters none; and ≈øometimes their Ma≈øters all, and the Prentices may ≈øtarve for Bread or Cloaths, their Ma≈øters, it may be, ≈øome of them, taking little care where they ≈øhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for when ≈øick and almo≈øt naked.</p>
            <p>6. See all Seamen to be encouraged to be able Seamen, and Mid≈øhip-men and Officers, as they are capable of; and not let any Captain's Boys receive Mid≈øhip-men's Pay for their Ma≈øters, and the Brave, Couragious, Loyal Seamen, that ≈øerved indeed for Mid≈øhip-men to be paid but as Able, or to be ≈øplit their Pay, one Mid≈øhip-man's Pay between Two Men; and this would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all Seamen that have Brains and Art, to ≈øtrive for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55757:9"/>and not have Lieutenants put over them, that never ≈øaw a Gun fired in anger, it may be, this War.</p>
            <p>7. As few Seamen as po≈ø≈øible to be turn'd from Ship to Ship; and if they are, to have Tickets given them for their former Ships, and the≈øe to be as Land-marks for their Pay, and not to be made Run afterwards; but ≈øent up to the Office for their Wives, or Friends, or Parents to receive their mony; and the≈øe turn'd over Tickets to be Regi≈øtred, and paid in cour≈øe, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three months at farthe≈øt, after the turning over; and none to buy any of them at above 3 <abbr>s</abbr> at mo≈øt, in the Pound Profit, on Pain of Forfeiture of thrice the value to the party grieved or oppre≈ø≈øed; and if tho≈øe who have extorted before, of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, out of their Tickets, above 4 <abbr>s</abbr> or at mo≈øt, 5 <abbr>s</abbr> in the Pound Profit, might Pay to the Party grieved and oppre≈ø≈øed 2<abbr>s</abbr> back for every ≈øhilling more profit; and that would not be ≈øo great a puni≈øhment as ≈øome may imagine; For if they extorted 10 <abbr>s</abbr> profit, and five being for time pa≈øt winked at, the other five paid back double, is but 10 <abbr>s</abbr> So that the poor extorted ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined Seaman, would have but 20 <abbr>s</abbr> at la≈øt for 20 <abbr>s</abbr> And if any ≈øay, there was no Law again≈øt the≈øe Extortioning Villains for time pa≈øt: To that I an≈øwer, I do ≈øuppo≈øe, unle≈øs the Extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners are wor≈øe than Heathens, there is the Law of Nature and of Chri≈øt, to do as they would be done unto.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly.</hi> unle≈øs tho≈øe Extortioners are wor≈øe than <hi>Turks,</hi> I have been often informed, that the <hi>Turks</hi> will ≈øeverely correct a <hi>Jew</hi> if he takes more than a moderate profit of a Chri≈øtian; they will beat the <hi>Jew</hi> ≈øeverely. And I do ≈øuppo≈øe that ≈øuch dreadful cur≈øed wretched Extortioners, as have bought ≈øome Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Pay at near a quarter of the value, were never heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> or the mo≈øt Savage and Barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the World; And tho≈øe very Seamen who are ≈øo Ruined, to lo≈øe their Health and Lives in the defence of that very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the≈øe Extortioners mu≈øt live, or be Slaves them≈øelves, and lo≈øe all at la≈øt.</p>
            <p>And I con≈øider, That if <hi>David</hi> would not drink of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> when the Three Mighty Men had ventured their Lives to fetch it, but ≈øaid, <hi>God forbid: is it not their Blood?</hi> Then how can the≈øe Nations expect to thrive, that put by the poor mi≈øerable Seamens Widows from their Pay; that was earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55757:10"/>not only with the peril of their Husband's Lives, but even fell ≈øick, and actually die on ≈øhore by rea≈øon thereof; or whether it be not very like inju≈øtice, or unmercifulne≈øs, and Cruelty, to cau≈øe ≈øo great multitudes to be deprived of their Pay, who have not been one Day or Month hardly out of the Service for ≈øeveral Years, as by the Ship's Books will appear, except by ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or death, that can be proved; and if tho≈øe, who have help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to throw more mi≈øery on them, be the only men that are in this Nation to Relieve them; the Lord, for Chrift's ≈øake, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve all Landmen from falling into ≈øuch Di≈øtre≈øs; for if Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øay to the≈øe Nations in Judgment, <hi>The ≈øame mea≈øure you mete, ≈øhall be mea≈øured to you again,</hi> it would be ≈øad; but what he will do is known only to him≈øelf; and what his good will and plea≈øure is to ≈øtir me up to write this, he only knoweth.</p>
            <p>And 8thly, Therefore there ought to be care taken what Seamen mu≈øt do for time to come, if they are ≈øet ≈øick on ≈øhore, and the Ships go away before they are well to ≈øecure their Pay; for I would appeal to all mankind, that hath Grace or Rea≈øon, yea, or Common Sence, whether it can be thought, that when there is ≈øeveral ≈øick Men in Ships, and they ≈øet on Shoar, ≈øome in one Port, and ≈øome in another; Whether the Ships mu≈øt wait until they are well, and how the ≈øame Men can get to their own Ships again when they are gone? And if they continue ≈øick or die, or go on board of other Ships, or be ≈øent to the Ho≈øpitals, and Run out of their Pay; whether this be not Inju≈øtice, Cruelty, Opre≈ø≈øion, Di≈øcouragement to the King's Service, and that whereby no Man in <hi>England</hi> can be ≈øafe to Serve his King and Country for time to come; nor no Man ≈øafe to tru≈øt a Seaman, or Seaman's Wife and Family, one Groat that is in the King's Service on tho≈øe terms, ≈øince the Stoute≈øt Man and Hone≈øte≈øt Man in <hi>England,</hi> by keeping long on Board, may fall Sick and Die, or continue Sick, and that a Year or two, and if not go on Board, or be Pre≈øt on board another Ship, and ≈øo loo≈øe his Pay: I do prote≈øt in the pre≈øence of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I Write this, I fear if there be none in the≈øe Nations to be found to con≈øider the≈øe dreadful Ca≈øes, but ≈øuffer Cruelty and inju≈øtice to be ≈ømugled up, that God will Cha≈øti≈øe the≈øe Nations, until they Learn what it is to Ruin Men and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in their Lives or Pay, thou≈øands and ten thou≈øands, as by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55757:10"/>the King's Pay-books and Mu≈øter-books will appear; and they I appeal to; they are ≈øuch a Regi≈øter the Nation never ≈øaw in the Sea Affairs, and the blame mu≈øt lie ≈øomewhere; and I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe ≈øome hardened Hearts will ≈øay the Running them out of their Pay, is right enough; but it may be they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider that their turning from Ship to Ship, until Sickne≈øs or Death came, was the Cau≈øe of a great part, and I hope they will not be ≈øo Ca≈øe-hardened as to ≈øay they were ≈øerved well enough to be Run out of their Lives, ≈øo many ten thou≈øands; al≈øo I remember the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Nation, in ≈øome former times, was mighty indu≈øtrious to find out, and Puni≈øh the In≈øtruments that Ruined the King's Liege-People in their Lives and E≈øtates; and had we had but the tenth part of Landmen's Poor Families Stripped of all they had in the World, as there hath been Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ≈øtripped of their Pay, it would have made a dreadful out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry in <hi>England:</hi> And indeed if our Poor in <hi>England</hi> had been forc'd to be turned from Ma≈øter to Ma≈øter, without a Penny of Mony for ≈øome Years, as many Seamen have from Ship to Ship, and their mi≈øerable Wives and Children Live on Credit, or Starve; and if at la≈øt they ≈øhould, under the burden of all by di≈øcouragements, fall ≈øick, and be Run out of their Mony, they had worked for ≈øeveral Years, as many have been out of their Pay in ≈øeveral Ships; it would look dreadfully bad. And ≈øome well-meaning men would have nothing ≈øaid of it to acquaint the Government, for fear our Enemies ≈øhould know it; as if the <hi>French,</hi> who hath taken ≈øo many hundred Ships from us, and near twenty thou≈øand Men Captive, this War, and hath ≈øo many Spies, and Treacherous Villains here, and doth, to outward appearance, know a great deal better where to meet our <hi>India</hi> Ships, and <hi>Berbado's</hi> Ships, in ≈øeveral places to take them Home to <hi>France,</hi> than ours did to ≈øend Convoys to take them Home to <hi>England;</hi> and yet ≈øome ≈øeeming Hone≈øt Men are afraid the <hi>French,</hi> that take our Ships and Men, ≈øhould know our Ca≈øe, and in ≈øhort, I fear he knows it a great deal more exactly than ≈øome do, or will do in <hi>England,</hi> for I do think ≈øome in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ≈øeem to do, like what is ≈øaid of the Woodcocks, to hide their Heads in a Bu≈øh, and think none can ≈øee them; and ≈øo if they let the King, Country and Seamen be all Cheated, it will continue to be all ≈ømuggled up; but my Pen runs thirteen
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55757:11"/>to the Dozen, and yet the knavery of the Bakers is ≈øuch, that if care be not taken, I am afraid ≈øome of our Seamens Families will be ready to ≈øtarve: but to that, I ≈øhould propo≈øe a Remedy, that Seamen may not be Cheated of their Health, Lives and Pay altogether.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, if as many as is po≈ø≈øible, might be Paid off every year, and that, it may be, would ≈øave mo≈øt of their Lives, mo≈øt of their Healths, and all their Pay be≈øides, and we might have Ships enough for a Winter Squadron be≈øides; and if any did fall Sick, then if the Ship goeth away and leaves him ≈øet on ≈øhoar, then if he cannot come on Board to ≈øet him in the Ships Book di≈ø-≈øick at ≈øuch a place and time, and the Man, if well to go on Board another Man of War, and to have the Captain of the Man of War ≈øend up a Certificate to the Office, That ≈øuch a man that was in ≈øuch a Ship, is now in his Ship, and this to be Entered in the other Ships Book in the Office to ≈øave the Poor Seamens Pay; and if the other Ships Book be not there, to have a Regi≈øter Book to enter it in the mean time; and if the Man continues Sick or Dies, the Surgeon of the place, he is ≈øent to, to be Bound to give a Certificate of his Ca≈øe to ≈øave his Pay, ≈øince it mu≈øt needs ≈øeem to me to be a barbarous thing towards any, for time pa≈øt, to be turn'd from Ship to Ship, for ≈øeveral Years; until they fall ≈øick and die, and then be Run out of their Pay; and it may be their poor Ruined Wives, who hardly have ≈øeen their Husbands this War, it may be they mu≈øt come 100 or 200 Miles, to ≈øhew cau≈øe why they mu≈øt have any mony, and why their Husbands went not on Board their own Ships again; and it may be the Ships Journal, if looked into at the Office, would ≈øhew the Ship went away in 24 hours: And if <hi>God will bring every work to Judgment,</hi> I doubt our Ships Books and Ships Journals will be ≈øad Witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt the Cruelty of ≈øome in tho≈øe Offices, to Run poor Wretches out of their Pay, that the men are, as the Sentence is again≈øt tho≈øe that are to be hanged, <hi>Dead, Dead, Dead.</hi> And therefore if I find not any Remedy again≈øt Ruining the Fatherle≈øs and the Widow, I will not expect any great Security of our Ships and Merchandi≈øe.</p>
            <p>And ≈øo much to that: God is a Jealous God: If we Ruin the Poor of Thirty Thou≈øand Pounds the Year, by ≈øome ≈øort of Tools, and God ≈øuffers the Nation to lo≈øe ≈øo many Hundred
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55757:11"/>Thou≈øand Pounds in Riches, and the King his Cu≈øtom, by the Ignorance, Carele≈øsne≈øs, and Treachery of others; if our own Folly be not too hard for us, I fear the Judgments of God will: and therefore I advi≈øe ≈øome way for the≈øe Nations to break off their ≈øins by Repentance, and their Iniquities, by ≈øhewing mercy to the Poor: and Mercy and Ju≈øtice both, will teach ways to ≈øecure Ruined Seamens Pay, when wounded, or dead, or in the Ho≈øpitals.</p>
            <p>9. It is a mi≈øerable thing, that when men are turn'd over, or dead, or ≈øick, that their poor Wives cannot be informed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their poor Ruined Husbands are Run out of their Pay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Petitioning; Which, if there be Twenty Thou≈øand Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings over in a Year, may make work for the Clerk of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his Ma≈øters. If they all Petition at 12 <abbr>
                  <hi>d</hi>
               </abbr> the Piece to him, it is a Thou≈øand Pound the Year, and 6<abbr>
                  <hi>d</hi>
               </abbr> to his Boy, is five hundred Pound the Year: And will not this be brave Times for him? But I remember, in all Calamities, ≈øome dreadful Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches get mony; in the time of the Plague of <hi>London,</hi> in the time of the Fire, and in the time of War, many are Rai≈øed from the Dunghill on the Ruines of others; but why poor Seamen them≈øelves, or their poor Wives, ≈øhould not have Liberty to get a Clerk to ≈øearch the Book, to ≈øee if they are cheated of their Pay or no, before Pay-day, is ≈øad. But I confe≈øs it is a good way to hide Knavery: For if mony be ≈øaid to be paid the Party, and was not, and he appears him≈øelf, it is a timely notice to get an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other book to ≈øhew him, that it was only ordered to be paid him. But if he be dead, or gone, and never come him≈øelf, then it may ≈øtand paid the party until Dooms-day; and if he comes, it was a mi≈øtake: And be≈øides this, having a ≈øight of the Books, may be a great help to Extortioners and Ticket-buyers, if they get the Books ≈øearched privately, they may buy as they plea≈øe; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not <hi>turning the blind out of their way,</hi> ≈øeeing the Seamens Wives have mo≈øt time nothing but the Books to know what is due; and if they be Run at Pay-day, it may be are forced to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and ≈øtay for their mony another year; and this is mi≈øery to mi≈øery.</p>
            <p>10. Therefore I think they ought, for time to come, to have no Seamen di≈øcharged without a Ticket, and no Officer keep his Ticket on pain of Felony; For in plain <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> which is wor≈øt,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55757:12"/>a Pick-pocket ≈øtealing a Guinea or Two from a Gentleman, or a Captain of a Man of War to take a Seaman's Ticket from him of Ten Pound, and it may be the poor Seaman, nor his Wife and Family, hath not a Groat in the World to buy a bit of bread? Therefore if there be not Relief to poor Ruined Seamen, I will never more wonder we fool away, knock on the Head, betray and de≈øtroy ≈øo many Men of War and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Ships. But,</p>
            <p>11. And none to wait above One Payment for One Ticket al≈øo, for time to come; and not wait 3 years for 30 <abbr>s</abbr> at Two Payments of a Ticket, as hath been common this War: And whether this was not Mi≈øery to Mi≈øery? And to prevent that,</p>
            <p>12. As few as po≈ø≈øible to be turn'd from Ship to Ship; but when Ships come in, pay them off as they come in, ≈øome one time, and ≈øome another; and the Men have a Month's Liberty to come on ≈øhore; and gather health and ≈øtrength, and ≈øpend their Mony; and when their Mony is gone, their Friends will quickly ≈øend them to Sea again, without pre≈ø≈øing; and that would be good for King and Country: And if Men ≈øee they are not ≈øhifted from Ship to Ship, like Slaves, they will, when paid off on ≈øhore, as in other Ages, have Encouragement to come into the Service again, and bring their Children, Servants and Friends with them. But if they find they are deprived of their Liberty all their Days, when once they come, and of their Property, when ≈øick and die, no marvel if they are glad to get away: And I would ask all Mankind, and would appeal to the King and Parliament what ≈øhould be the Cau≈øe the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice now ≈øhould be more a Pri≈øon than in other Ages? and why ≈øo Gracious a King's Service ≈øhould be made ≈øuch a Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear now; and ≈øuch Lo≈øs of Liberty, Property and Lives to the Seamen now more than in any Age of the World; and whether it be not an unmerciful, unju≈øt, and an unrea≈øonable Argument to pretend the Seamen cannot be admitted to come on ≈øhore to be paid now, as in other Ages, becau≈øe they will Run away: Whereas, in the mean time, they are kept turn'd and to≈ø≈øed from Ship to Ship, until more die than would Man the Fleet; and in the mean time al≈øo, more Run away from the Service than would Man it all and half over again: And if they are Run out of their Pay wrongfully, it is ≈øhameful and cruel; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55757:12"/>if Ju≈øtly, their New Management has frightned more Seamen out of the Service, to the appearance of the Ship's Books, this Seven Years la≈øt, than hath Run away in this Nation, I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ≈øuppo≈øe, this fifty years, if all the Old Books and New Books were ≈øearched. So that I ≈øay, Experience ≈øhews the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery of that Argument of paying them on board Ship, by the Lo≈øs of near Forty Thou≈øand Lives, and ≈øixty or ≈øeventy Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Men's Pay: Whereas, had their Lives been pre≈øerved, and their Pay encouraged on ≈øhore, in all likelihood Seamen would have been ≈øo increa≈øed, and thereby their Pay in Merchant Ships near half Ie≈øs: That con≈øidering the hazard of Lo≈øt Voyages in Merchant Ships, they would there have Thou≈øands of them proved my Words good, that I u≈øed to ≈øay to them at fir≈øt, That the King's Service was the be≈øt in <hi>England;</hi> No half Pay, no Dammage, no Lo≈øt Voyage; and if pinched of their Diet, the King pays the Pinch-gut-mony al≈øo hone≈øtly.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>I</hi> would by the way con≈øider, that we cannot expect to be in ≈øafety for time to come, without we do by Humility, Ju≈øtice and Mercy, engage God to ≈øtand by us, and give us Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Ble≈ø≈øing in the fir≈øt place.</p>
            <p>And 2dly, As to outward means, in a vi≈øible way, we cannot be ≈øafe and happy in times of Peace or War, without an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Thou≈øand Seamen in <hi>England.</hi> My Rea≈øon is this, That tho now we have the <hi>Dutch</hi> united with us, and it may be ≈øave 20 or 30 Ships, and 10000 Men, the time may fall out we may ≈øtand alone; and 2dly, What hath been, may be; and the <hi>French</hi> and another Nation have Joyned again≈øt us; and then we need double the Strength and Number of Men we have now; and that to maintain a War and Merchant Trade both; and if we do not that we are Ruined for want of Trade; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this I would ≈øay, Tho our Lo≈ø≈øes have been dreadful this War, and God knows, many of them blindfold, and ≈øcandalous and ignorant; yet it was a great mercy we traded; Our poor had been Ruined, if we had not Traded; all our Manufactory-workers would have been ready to peri≈øh, and commit, it may be, any mi≈øchief; for it hath been with the Nation as it may be, in ≈øome part, with my ≈øelf; There are ≈øome that have by the Providence of God a Sub≈øi≈øtence from me; I trade, and tru≈øt, and lo≈øe much; I pay them, ble≈ø≈øed be God, they live by their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55757:13"/>Labour, and ≈øome might ≈øtarve, if they had not that, or the Pari≈øhes mu≈øt keep them; others, it may be, get Mony, more than I, under me, becau≈øe I ≈øtand to all hazards, and they to none, but take my Mony. So it is in a Nation; if we had not Traded this War, we had been Ruined; and if we lo≈øe not more than we get clear Profit, we ≈øhall live at la≈øt; tho, by the way, the World may admire at us, that have near twice the Number of Men of War imploy'd that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have, and yet that they ≈øhould have ≈øo many Millions of Riches come home from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and other parts, this year, and other years, and hardly lo≈øe any almo≈øt to ≈øpeak of, except what they have lo≈øt in our Company; for where they take care of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them≈øelves, for the mo≈øt part they go and come well. But in conclu≈øion, I do ≈øuppo≈øe, be≈øides their pre≈øervation of their Shipping, if I am not under a mi≈øapprehen≈øion, they ≈øave a Million of Mony a year more than we in their Ships of War, and Mens Wages, and it may be half a Million more in the very Wages of Seamen in their Merchants Service; and if they ≈øpend le≈øs by half, and lo≈øe le≈øs by Eight Parts in Ten, they will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do us in Trade; and it is not our making a Noi≈øe, and keeping our Seamen on Board of Ship until they die, will ≈øave our Trade alive; but fir≈øt the ble≈ø≈øing of God; 2. The increa≈øe and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of our Seamen, and our pre≈øerving them alive; and having enough to ≈øupply the Merchant-men with Seamen cheap, and then having Men to order our Convoys, at lea≈øt with as much common ≈øen≈øe to pre≈øerve our Merchant Ships, and meet them as ≈øoon, and take them home to <hi>England,</hi> for time to come, as the <hi>French</hi> u≈øe to do; to meet them to take them home to <hi>France,</hi> that we may not be a Grief to our Friends, and a Joy to our Enemies, and a by-word to the World. I ble≈øs God I love my Native Country well, and our gracious King <hi>William</hi> well; and if I did not, I would not be ≈øo plain hearted. And as to what I ≈øaid before, we mu≈øt, for time to come, imploy at lea≈øt half as many Seamen more in times of Peace, than ever we did; and to do it in time of Peace, if we would, when ever God in Mercy ≈øends us peace; then mind the very Fi≈øhing Trade at our own Doors, as others do. I find it computed by one Sir <hi>John Burrows,</hi> Keeper of the Records in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and printed with <hi>Gerard Malines Lex Mercatoriae,</hi> which I have by me, That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55757:13"/>the <hi>Dutch</hi> do imploy in our <hi>Britti≈øh</hi> Sea, which he ≈øaith is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Harve≈øt, and doth imploy 6400 Ships and Bu≈ø≈øes, and 120000 Men at Sea; whereby he ≈øaith, That <hi>Holland</hi> it ≈øelf being but 28 Miles in length, and a few in breadth, imploys in all their Sea-Trade 10000 Sail of Shipping; and he ≈øaith, That <hi>Lubeck</hi> hath 700 Sail of Ships, <hi>Hamborough</hi> 600, <hi>Emden</hi> more, be≈øides Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and other Nations that Fi≈øh and Trade in our Seas: And he ≈øaith, That the very Cu≈øtoms of their Fi≈øhing Trade of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> came to 500000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> the Year, including the Tenth Fi≈øh, and Cask paid for Waftage. And this, if thought of by <hi>England,</hi> when ever God ≈øhall ≈øend Peace, would be the way to imploy and increa≈øe our Seamen, and to have a ≈øufficient Number always ready to ≈øerve the King and Country at 2 Months Warning; and not ≈øuffer our Seamen, in Peace, to rove all over the world for imployment to get bread, yea to go ≈øome Thou≈øands into the <hi>We≈øt Indies</hi> a Buckaneering, for want of bread at home. This is by the way. It may be ≈øomething of this may be minded ≈øome Years hence. And this I would leave as a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> That ≈øince <hi>France</hi> is grown ≈øo prodigious Great, if we double not our Diligence, they will endeavour to out-wit us in Peace or War: and it may be they may be to <hi>England</hi> as the <hi>Phili≈øtines</hi> were to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> when we fall deeply to ≈øinning, they may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed up to ≈øcourge us; and the Lord prevent the Cau≈øe, and if it be his holy Will, enable us to bring them under.</p>
            <p>11. And I would ≈øay, That all po≈ø≈øible care ought to be taken, that tho≈øe, who have the Command and Offices in the Ships of War, ≈øhould be Men of true Courage in fight, and true Kindne≈øs to the Seamen at other times: And I would appeal to all our Brave Commanders, if the Seamen, with good u≈øage, will not be led with a twined Thread, up to the Muzzels of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Guns, at any time, by Stout, good Natur'd Commanders: But hate to be abu≈øed like Dogs. And I am con≈øulting my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and do not remember any one Commander that was an Hectoring, and Swearing, Damning, Cruel Wretch to his Men, that ever had the Heart to fight an Enemy: And therefore it were in this Age well, if there were a Law made. <hi>Tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>16. None to ≈øet a <hi>Q.</hi> or <hi>R.</hi> on any Seaman's Pay, but to ≈øhew Cau≈øe, and ≈øet his Name that did it, that Seamen may not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Life, and Death and Pay and All, by they know not who, nor wherefore.</p>
            <p>17. None to receive a Seaman's Pay without a true Power; and if Counterfeited, to have the Middle Joint of each Little Finger cut off, and be ≈øold to the <hi>We≈øt-Indies</hi> for perpetual Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude all their Days.</p>
            <p>18. No Officer to detain a Seaman's Certificate, or Sick-Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, on any pretence whatever.</p>
            <p>19. No Officer to keep Men open on the Books a Voyage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are gone, neither to make out Tickets for them, or to enter Men in the Ship's Books, that never ≈øaw the Ship in their Lives. And to prevent this and the other, and the Cheating the King; and Lo≈øs of Ships, and Ruin of Seamen for time to come, there might be,</p>
            <p>20. One man in 20 that can write and Ca≈øt Accompt, to be as Seamen <hi>extra,</hi> to keep a Journal ≈øign'd by them all, of the daily motion of the Ship, in what place, what Wind, and what Friends or Enemies met with, or run away from; and al≈øo to take an Exact Account of all the Ship's Victuals and Stores coming on Beard, to ≈øee that it is the full Quantity, and that no Embelli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be in the Stores, nor no Victuals ≈øhort, ≈øince the King allows enough of all the≈øe things, if men ≈øhuffle it not away; and al≈øo to ≈øee the men mu≈øtered every week all the Voyage on board, to prevent their being entred that never come on board; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55757:14"/>they kept open that Run away: And that al≈øo the Seamen <hi>extra</hi> might be Learning to carry a Ship to Sea in any part of the World, and con≈øulted with in ca≈øe of Danger, that Ships might not be knockt on the head, or fool'd away, for time to come, ≈øo madly as in ≈øome times pa≈øt; and the≈øe men to have ≈øix ≈øhillings the Month more than Able Seamen; and to be preferr'd, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving.</p>
            <p>21. In regard that the Boat≈øwains, Gunners and Carpenters are Places of great Care and Tru≈øt, and ≈øome Expences in the getting in, and taking care of, and accounting for their Stores, and their Wages being, it may be, under-valued, in re≈øpect of tho≈øe who have double Pay, if his Maje≈øty, and the Honourable Hou≈øes, would advance their Pay half as much more as they have now, and this would be the way to encourage them to be hone≈øt, faithful and cheery in the Service; and they that are not hone≈øt, to be puni≈øhed: if they are found to ≈øteal the King's Store, then they and the Parties who are the Receivers, which are as bad as the Thieves, to be every man that is found guilty, marked on the Little Fingers, and tran≈øported for Servants to the <hi>We≈øt-Indies,</hi> all their Days, as tho≈øe that would infect others if they ≈øtaid here: And to find out all Theft, if there were this Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That whatever Seamen 2 or 3 could prove the ≈øame, to have their di≈øcharge from the Ship, on the Conviction of the Offender, and Tickets for their own mony, to be paid pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the <hi>Pay-Office,</hi> and a Protection for One Year from the Pre≈øs, except they can be preferr'd in the time to ≈øome place, into ≈øome other Ship. And this would be the way to have almo≈øt all the Thieves in the Fleet, and in the Yards di≈øcovered, and without Charge or Lo≈øs to the King. But if men who di≈øcover Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be abu≈øed, brow-beaten and back-beaten, and confin'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it all their days, no marvel if there is ≈øeldom any Thievery found out, if never ≈øo much committed.</p>
            <p>22. No Pur≈øers, or Captains Clerks, or any Officers, to give a Li≈øt of Names to others, to forge Powers, or to deliver out Tickets to any, but publickly; and to tho≈øe who have Powers, that are Lawful to take the ≈øame; and none to ≈øell or receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Seaman's Pay or Ticket, except their own Indenture-Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, on Pain of Felony, as being wor≈øe than Highway-men.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55757:15"/>
            <p>23. There to be a Committee to hear the Complaints of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ho≈øe who have been oppre≈ø≈øed, cheated, or ruined in their Pay; and to hear all Complaints freely, and to re≈øtore Ju≈øtice to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, as tho≈øe who would not have the hand of God go out again≈øt our Navigation any more, to the ≈øuffering either our own Folly or the Enemies Subtilty to ruin us.</p>
            <p>24. That whenever Ships are put up for Re-calls at <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtreet,</hi> for Pay, there be a certain time appointed for each Ship, and publick notice given at lea≈øt 6 days before-hand, for all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to appear, that have Mony due, that they may not lo≈øe their Pay, or come at ≈øuch uncertainties for ≈ømall ≈øums, that the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charge, and lo≈øs of time, is worth more than the Mony receiv'd.</p>
            <p>25. That there may be al≈øo an appointment of ≈øome of the Commi≈ø≈øioners, that ≈øtate the publick Accounts, to hear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all Informations, wherein the King and Nation have been cheated, and liberty to grant a ≈øafe Conduct to any one to come and appear before them, to make a full and free di≈øcovery, and to let them depart home without mole≈øtation again; and if their Information be worthy of a Pardon, that it might be interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; if not, that they might be left open to the Law, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And that, if any one, that hath been guilty of Cheating, and forging of Powers, can di≈øcover two others as bad as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, ≈øo as they may be convicted, then the fir≈øt to be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the other two puni≈øhed: And if the other two can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them di≈øcover two more, that is four as bad as them≈øelves, the two to be excu≈øed, and the four corrected, unle≈øs any of them could double their Information, as afore≈øaid; and this would be one way, perhaps, to find out how the King, and the Nation, and the Seamen may be mode≈øtly Judged to be cheated of 100 or 150000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> a year this War.</p>
            <p>And now I having propo≈øed this, it may be I ≈øhall meet with ≈øome Enemies that will envy me ten times wor≈øe than the Thieves envied him that wrote the Book that is called, <hi>The Engli≈øh Rogue;</hi> and yet if they were ≈øo wi≈øe, as to keep their own Coun≈øel, none would know I meant them; for indeed, I ble≈øs God I aim not again≈øt per≈øons, but Villany; and if I meet with any that is offended at me for di≈øcovering the Method of the Navy-Cheats, I ≈øhall think it is ≈øome body that is galled and ≈øcabbed; and that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55757:15"/>I touched them, tho I did not ≈øee them, and therefore they kick and bite, as ≈øome Hor≈øes will do. And ≈øo much to that. I would advi≈øe them to keep their own Coun≈øel, that others may not laugh at them; and if they laugh them≈øelves, and are plea≈øed, the World will be ready to judge they are glad if I can hunt out the Scabby Sheep out of their Flock. But I would propo≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning tho≈øe many thou≈øands that are taken captive into <hi>France,</hi> if it were in <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Ships.</p>
            <p>26. That they that are taken may have their ≈øeveral mi≈øeries con≈øidered of, how they are u≈øed in <hi>France;</hi> and if their ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be ≈øo great, that they are ready to peri≈øh there for want, it would be well if ≈øome Relief were ordered them, that they might not die, and peri≈øh there, or be forced to enter into the <hi>French</hi> Service for Liberty, Bread and Cloaths, and therefore to be ≈øent for away, al≈øo ≈øo ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible they can conveniently.</p>
            <p>27. When come to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> or any Sea-Port Town in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to have at lea≈øt a penny a mile allowed every Seaman for Travelling Charges to <hi>London,</hi> if in Men of War, and to where their Friends live, if in Merchant Ships, that they may not be forc'd to beg or ≈øtarve for near 200 miles, and at la≈øt be forc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into other Ships, without one penny of mony to buy them Clothes for to ≈øhift them: And it may be con≈øidered, if it be not a barbarous thing to meet men as far as <hi>King≈øton,</hi> coming home out of <hi>France,</hi> with nothing but their Lou≈øie Old Cloaths the <hi>French</hi> give them, and when they have begged 150 miles, to carry them away, lay them in the Hold in Pre≈øs-Ketches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bedding, or any thing to lie under or over them; and it may be the poor Wretches ≈øickly and weak, ≈øome of them: And this is now at this time one Fruit of our keeping Seamen on board, and paying them there, that they ≈øhould not Run away, until there is ≈øo many dead and gone, that there is dreadful Tearing ann Halling in City and Country, and the very Watermen out of the Tiltboats, that they are afraid to work on their Trades, ≈øome of them now, while our great Ships are ≈øo many laid up: And by the way, this pre≈ø≈øing, when Men were paid lately, frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away ≈øome Hundreds or Thou≈øands of Seamen: Whereas if they had but had <hi>liberty</hi> to have ≈øpent their <hi>mony freely</hi> in one month, they would have been glad to have gone again. I have heard a Friend of mine declare <hi>≈øolemnly,</hi> He had above 20 Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55757:16"/>that belonged to his Hou≈øe, went <hi>away</hi> to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, not daring to come up to <hi>London</hi> to ≈øpend their <hi>money here,</hi> or return it home to their Friends; and if <hi>≈øo many be ≈øeared away</hi> in one hou≈øe, <hi>how many</hi> in all the hou≈øes that keep Lodgers in <hi>City and Suburbs?</hi> Therefore men mu≈øt be taken care of for time to come, to have their Lives pre≈øerved, and their per≈øons encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; or if not, I fear it will produce greater Lo≈øs and Damage than is yet fore≈øeen; And all mankind that knows the Sea-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; knows that 2 or 3 Years keeping on board of Ship, <hi>common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 3 fourths of the men die: whereas if <hi>they had liberty,</hi> and fre≈øh provi≈øions, and Land-Air, one month often recruits them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>28. Therefore the Seamen to be encouraged, and pre≈øerved, and paid off at <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>formerly,</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> would not be Ruined by the War. And if it be objected, <hi>The Seamen would then go in Merchant-Ships, many of them.</hi> To that I do an≈øwer, if their Lives were pre≈øerved, they would increa≈øe as fa≈øt or fa≈øter in Men of War than in Merchant-Ships: and if there were <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Wages would fall in Merchant-Ships. And had our Fleet increa≈øed Seamen, as it was expected, the Wages would have been ≈øo low in Merchant-Ships, and what with <hi>Lo≈øt Voyages,</hi> Seamen would have ≈øtrived to have gone into the King's Ships, if they had been paid off in <hi>every Ship,</hi> and had <hi>Liberty.</hi> But when they have no hopes of Relea≈øe, but Death, or the End of the War, and cannot <hi>have opportunity</hi> to fight to end the War, this is <hi>a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Ca≈øe:</hi> many of them have complained they wanted to fight it out for to end the War. And,</p>
            <p>29. This paying the Seamen off on Shore yearly, that is, one half one Year, and another half another Year, would many times ≈øave the King near as much charge in ≈ømall Ships Victuals and Wages, while as our Ship is in the Dock, as the charge of mending the Ship comes to. And indeed this War hath been, it may be, ≈øuch a Di≈øappointment to Seamen, as the World ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew, ≈øome Commanders having had ≈øo much Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and Care, as to have Men to Man a Ship; and it may be in ≈øome months after, either the men turn'd great part into other Ships, or the Commanders removed into other Ships; ≈øo that if a Thou≈øand Seamen would be freely willing to ≈øerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øuch brave Commanders, as I know ≈øome, they are not ≈øure,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55757:16"/>but in a month they may exchange their Drivers. And by the way, I would ob≈øerve, That tho the Double-Pay Officers have had Pay ≈øuitable to buy Two Canes to beat the poor Seamen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of one; whereas before, they ≈øometimes did tie a Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarn at the end of their Cleft Sticks, but now may buy new; but the poor Seamen had not 1 <abbr>s</abbr> the month more all this War, to buy one cour≈øe Coat or Wa≈øtcoat to keep off a blow. Which brings me to another Paragraph, that is,</p>
            <p>30. That the poor Seamen may have their 40 <abbr>s</abbr> a piece for Cloaths, u≈øed to be allowed them if the Ship was lo≈øt; and this they had before they beat the <hi>French;</hi> and before that, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ≈øome Comforts now and then. But to go on,</p>
            <p>31. No Seamen to be forced to go out of a Man of War in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Merchant-Ship, altho the Captain ≈øhould have ≈øeveral pounds for the ≈øame. But if Nece≈ø≈øity requires the Lending of a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Two to a Merchant, the Seaman may have all the <hi>Pay</hi> in the Merchant-Ship, and the Captain and Pur≈øer to have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his Victuals only in the Man of War, that the King and the Seamen be not both cheated at one time. And,</p>
            <p>32. The Seaman to have a Certificate to come again in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, and to be kept from the Pre≈øs until then.</p>
            <p>33. No Seaman to be made wait above ten days at the Navy-Office, to petition for to have a <hi>Q</hi> or <hi>R.</hi> taken off. But if when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paid-off, as formerly, and incouraged, there would be an end almo≈øt to that dreadful wretched Ruining and De≈øtruction to them≈øelves and Families, of lo≈øing their mony, for tho≈øe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being ≈øet on by any <hi>wrongfully;</hi> and therefore would ≈øerve the King cheerfully.</p>
            <p>34. That tho≈øe, who are di≈øcharged fair, by Rea≈øon of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and have Tickets ≈øigned by all the Officers for their <hi>Pay,</hi> may not be cheated of it, for the word of one hard hearted wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's plea≈øure, the Seamen's Ruin being too great already.</p>
            <p>35. If Seamen are pre≈øt away when on Shore, the Captain that commands the Ship he is in, to be obliged to ≈øend a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Ticket-Office, to be Regi≈øtred in the other Ship's book, or in a Regi≈øter-Book, as in the Ca≈øe before of Sickne≈øs, to ≈øecure the Seaman's <hi>Pay</hi> from being ruined, becau≈øe he lo≈øt his Liberty.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55757:17"/>
            <p>36. That it may be con≈øidered there are 3 things <hi>Engli≈øhmen</hi> do value highly, that is, <hi>Liberty, Property and Life,</hi> and all the≈øe have the Seamen lo≈øt ≈øome ≈øhare of this War, and the Hi≈øtories of all the≈øe Nations cannot parallel; and therefore double Care ought to be taken of them for time to come, ≈øeeing it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there is ≈øome gone to enquire after the pre≈øerving of tho≈øe things in other Nations already, as by the King's Books of Ships come home this Year, may be ≈øeen ≈øomething.</p>
            <p>37. Seamen pre≈ø≈øed out of Merchant-Ships, to be under the penalty of half their <hi>Pay,</hi> to go on board of ≈øuch a Man of War, at ≈øuch a time, and then to have liberty to bring up the <hi>Merchant-Ship,</hi> and to take half their <hi>Pay,</hi> and ≈øell their Ventures, and recruit them≈øelves a few <hi>days,</hi> to recover their health, that they may not, after long Voyages, infect the men of War by ≈øickne≈øs; and when they are gone on board, that man of War to have a Certificate ≈øent up to the Office, <hi>That ≈øuch a man is come on board ≈øuch a Man of War;</hi> and then his other half of his <hi>Pay</hi> to be paid to his Attorney: And if he goeth not on board the <hi>Man of War,</hi> or if ≈øhe be ordered away ≈øooner, than on board another; then the other half of his <hi>Pay</hi> to be forfeit to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpital of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> if he goeth not in <hi>a Man of War.</hi> And by this means mo≈øt of the Seamen might be in the King's Service once in 2 Years, and the others that have been there di≈øcharged, and paid off, would plea≈øe the Seamen, increa≈øe them, ≈øave their Lives and Pay. And if ≈øo, there might be a Law made, to cau≈øe all <hi>Ma≈øters</hi> to regi≈øter them that come home for the King's u≈øe, before they are paid, and all other Regi≈øters will be too ≈øhort, there being, it may be, 40000 Seamen Batchelors, or ≈øuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found to be regi≈øtred, but lodge 40 or 50 in a hou≈øe; and if regi≈øtred there, can be gone 100 miles next week. But good Pay, their Lives pre≈øerved, and good loving Commnaders, that will fight with their Enemies, and be as kind to the Seamen as Lambs, would ≈øet almo≈øt all to Rights again in a Year or Two, if they be not ruined at the new way of management in the Offices afterward.</p>
            <p>38. And therefore they that are ≈øent to the Ho≈øpitals, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Year or 2 ≈øick, mu≈øt not be cheated out of their pay, or have that barbarous word told to a peri≈øhing Wife, <hi>That her Husband ≈øhould not have been ≈øick;</hi> when if he had been ≈øick two Years, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55757:17"/>before quite well, crawled into a <hi>Man of War again,</hi> and there continued, might de≈øerve, more e≈øpecially if the Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have Relief of the Pari≈øhes, and the man ≈øtill in the Service al≈øo.</p>
            <p>And indeed I find our Poor's Book in the Suburbs, below the <hi>Tower,</hi> ≈ømell very ≈øtrong of the Ruin of the Seamen's Families; our Taxes for the Poor being doubled: And it may be ≈øome that would grudg to give a poor ruined Seaman's Family 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>d</hi>
               </abbr> to buy them bread, if they were ready to ≈øtarve, may yet blame me for troubling my head with their Ca≈øes, and Ruins, and mi≈øeries: but however, my Con≈øcience beareth me Witne≈øs, that I ≈øerve God and King <hi>William,</hi> and the good Old <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> Intere≈øt, in what I do: And ≈øo long as I have ≈øweet peace within, I cannot ≈øo much as <hi>fear any thing of trouble can hurt me;</hi> for, I ble≈øs God, <hi>I</hi> have <hi>learned in part, as a Chri≈øtian, to be content with what God allotteth me;</hi> And <hi>I</hi> have <hi>al≈øo learn'd</hi> this Principle, <hi>That an hone≈øt man is not ≈øubject to injury; a man may kill him, but cannot hurt him.</hi> And now <hi>I</hi> ≈øpeak of that, makes me think of ≈øome that threatned to ≈øacrifice me la≈øt Year; and when the News was brought my dear Wife, ≈øhe was frighted: But I ble≈øs God I feared it not: For as God carrieth me on, that I cannot let the Ruin, and De≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Cruelty, and Inju≈øtice, that is exerci≈øed on our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Seamen, more than ever the World ≈øaw, to be hid from the King and Parliament; ≈øo by the Grace of God, he carrieth me above fear of any ≈øufferings, ≈øo long as I have Truth on my ≈øide, and tho≈øe Two Graces of my ≈øide, Ju≈øtice and Mercy, that will bear me up. But if all the Rea≈øon and Under≈øtanding I have left, do not fail me, I have all the common Policy of my ≈øide that can be imagined. And now I ≈øpeak to that, I will be plain hearted and declare my Opinion, That I do verily think, if there were no Policy on my ≈øide, that if the Seamen were oppre≈ø≈øed and ruined, they and their Families, as multitudes have been, the Ju≈øtice of God would awake again≈øt the Nation.</p>
            <p>And 2. I do al≈øo verily judge if there were no provoking E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in their Ruin, they are ruined ≈øo madly, and dead, and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ≈øo ≈øhamefully, that it would be the way to ≈øpoil our ≈øelves at la≈øt, if it proceeds much farther; for their Ruin doth increa≈øe the pretence of keeping them turn'd from Ship to Ship, or catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them next day, or the ≈øame they are paid: And if there be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55757:18"/>not liberty of fre≈øh Air and fre≈øh Provi≈øions, Experience ≈øhews the ≈øalt Seas and ≈øalt Victuals, in ≈øtaying long in Ships, kills ten times more than the Sword: And God forbid, that the <hi>French</hi> ≈øhould bave cau≈øe to rejoice, and ≈øay, as long as this War la≈øts, he need not fight to kill our men; for they die fa≈øter without his fighting. And in ≈øhort, if this War had been a Game at Cards, I ≈øhould have feared ≈øome Game≈øters plaid booty; if it had been a Suit of Law, I ≈øhould have verily Judged there were ≈øome took double Fees. But my wandring, roving Brains do rather think our Sea-Affairs look more like that Rude Play, call'd, <hi>Blind man's Buff;</hi> for we have had ≈øeveral ≈øcurvy hard blows, that we could not well tell who it was that did hit us: But however it is, my Wi≈ødom is too ≈ømall to unriddle the whole, altho I have Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ≈øecret Notions that at pre≈øent ≈øerve for my own in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And this that I write is ≈øomething that bubbles over; And if any ≈øhould go farther, and ≈øay, <hi>Whatever the Game was, ≈øome that were either to hold or decide ≈øome of the Stakes, have gotten great E≈øtates, let as many Game≈øters as will, be ruined.</hi> Now that I would leave to tho≈øe, who have more skill to determine. I am almo≈øt a≈øhamed of this rambling di≈øcour≈øe, and will now ≈øay what comes next to hand; and that is, That we had need to ≈øecure our Walls; and if the Seamen are call'd our Walls, they had need to be repaired all that is po≈ø≈øible; And if any ≈øay, Great part of them are new ones, and ≈øo ≈øhould la≈øt well; To that I an≈øwer, it may fall out the newer they are, the more apt to fall; whereas tho≈øe which are old and ≈øea≈øoned, if pre≈øerved any thing like, would do better: And to that I might ≈øay, Perhaps it is ≈øo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; for in <hi>England</hi> we need never want men for the Sea; but Seamen are men ≈øea≈øoned to the Sea. And by the way I would ob≈øerve, That our brave Seamen that have been 7 Years in the Service, they never had a penny Bounty-mony in the Spring; it is they that come in afterwards get Bounty-mony: And I have wondred, tho≈øe that managed the Seamen did not think of ≈øome incouragement for tho≈øe who ≈øtood all the time, as well as for tho≈øe who come in the la≈øt week. It is an old ≈øaying in <hi>England, The Eye of the Ma≈øter makes the Hor≈øe fat;</hi> And indeed, if our mo≈øt gracious King <hi>William</hi> had been Rightly informed, to have ≈øeen the Ca≈øe of his Loyal Seamen, they would have been in better plight. And this brings me to con≈øider, That the Victualling of

            <p>39. It were well for the Seamen, if the Pur≈øers were bound, and made to take all the Sea-≈øtores on board of Ship, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive any ≈øhort at the Office at fir≈øt, neither to ≈øell any away before they come as far as my Hou≈øe, and that is not a mile from the Victualling-Office; and then Ships need not go to ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance often in 14 days after they are at Sea; and if that were prevented, it were well. But it may be they may plead, They can an≈øwer it, becau≈øe if they are found out, they mu≈øt pay for it: Now to that I would ≈øay, it is well for all the Nobility's, and Gentry's, and Yeomen's Hor≈øes in <hi>England,</hi> that they have not Pur≈øers to feed them; that if their Ma≈øters allow them 10 or 20 Quarters of Oats for a Stable, the Grooms, that ≈øhould feed them, take a third of them, and ≈øell them, and drink away the mony between the Drivers and the Grooms; and reckon ≈øo many Pecks a day; and if the Hor≈øes are abroad at work, and come not in time, charge their Oats to the Ma≈øter's Account, tho they are ≈øold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and they eat none in 2 or 3 days, or a week: And indeed, bad Drivers and bad Feeders is enough to ≈øpoil any Team of Hor≈øe in the World. I have heard among Countrymen, in <hi>Kent,</hi> ≈øome ≈øay, There is half in half difference in driving Cattle; ≈øome will beat them, and whip them, and knock them over the Pate, and ≈øwear and damn like Devils at the Cattle, and ≈øpoil them, that they will hardly drive at all, or it may be break their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and run away, and ≈øpoil the Team at la≈øt; whereas, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that knows how to manage them with care, and cheereth them up, clappeth them on the back with his hand, and chirups lovingly to them, they will draw like Lions. And in ≈øhort, I will appeal to all the Yeomen in <hi>Kent,</hi> many of whom are my Relations, if ever they knew a Team of Hor≈øe get a Groat clear Gains for their Ma≈øters, at 7 Years End, who≈øe Drivers and Ho≈øtlers had ruined them half, and near ≈øtarved ≈øome of the re≈øt, and cheated their Ma≈øters in the mean time of more a great deal than their Provender came to. But I had need intreat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for my rambling; but ≈øometimes there may be Abundance of homely Truths ≈øpoken in Je≈øt; <hi>and it may be too true to make a Je≈øt of.</hi>

            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55757:19"/>
            <p>But however, now to the Seamen of <hi>England;</hi> They are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as true to the Intere≈øt of King <hi>William,</hi> to the la≈øt, as any ≈øort of men whatever; and many of tho≈øe, who have ≈øtood in the King's Books as <hi>Run-aways,</hi> are either dead in his Service, and that is the la≈øt they can do for him; and others are ≈øtill in his Service to this hour, tho Run out of their Pay in other Ships; And in ≈øhort, it looks very mi≈øerable al≈øo, to be Run out of their Pay in other Ships, and cannot obtain leave once in 3 or 4 Years to come to ≈øhew Cau≈øe, or hear Rea≈øon why they ≈øhould have their mony. I remember the <hi>Heathen Romans</hi> are ≈øaid to take <hi>care not to condemn men without being heard ≈øpeak for them≈øelves, and al≈øo ≈øeeing their Accu≈øers.</hi> Now if it be objected, that it cannot be expected all that are made Run ≈øhould ≈øee their Accu≈øers, yet for the 2d, they might have this priviledge <hi>Heathens</hi> allowed of, <hi>≈øpeaking for them≈øelves:</hi> And therefore I think in the next place,</p>
            <p>40. It is but Rea≈øon and Ju≈øtice the Seamen that are made Run, ≈øhould be protected 14 days, to petition to get off their <hi>R. S.</hi> But I am much afraid that it will be found Cruelty at la≈øt, to make men lo≈øe their <hi>Pay</hi> that are dead a-≈øhore, or ≈øick in the Ho≈øpitals, or not a month out of the King's Service the≈øe ≈øeveral Years, or di≈øcharged fair by Tickets ≈øigned by all the Officers. And this I would ask, <hi>Whether the King's Service be a perpetual bondage?</hi> That tho a man be Really ≈øick, and have a Ticket given him to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him ≈øick, ≈øigned by all the Officers, to clear him, and get his <hi>Pay,</hi> whether it be not Oppre≈ø≈øion and Cruelty in tho≈øe that ≈øhould pay the mony, to deprive the≈øe men of their mony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they, that they left their Powers with, do not know pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the man is, or whether living or dead, or in what Ship; and it may be, it is ≈øome Years pa≈øt ≈øince he was di≈øcharged, and whether <hi>this way of management be like to encourage the Seamen, or any that tru≈øt them, or the like?</hi> In plain <hi>Engli≈øh, Such managers would fright away the Seamen, and fright others from tru≈øting them.</hi> And now I have ≈øaid this, it may be ≈øome will think I write this for intere≈øt, and am concerned with ≈øuch a Ca≈øe. To that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, No; for I left off buying 3 Years pa≈øt, and now write on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ≈øerve God, and my King and Country; And if I were in another Country, and ≈øhould hear the≈øe things, it may be I might be a≈øhamed of tho≈øe kind of Actions, and Abundance more, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55757:19"/>I fear are again≈øt <hi>Law and Go≈øpel; and Hone≈øty and Policy,</hi> yea, and I fear again≈øt good <hi>Heathen Morality;</hi> and ≈øeems to be <hi>all Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> But now I hope our Gracious King and Loyal Parliament have e≈øpou≈øed the <hi>Seamen's Cau≈øe,</hi> they will, as an hone≈øt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Hou≈øe of Commons ≈øaid, endeavour to do them Right. And this ≈øhort Prayer I will put up for the Seamen for time to come, <hi>That the King and Parliament would not leave them and their Families to the tender mercies of the wicked;</hi> for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that cannot lie, ≈øaith, <hi>That the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> And it may be ≈øome that have been a year a getting a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for Ju≈øtice An≈øwered, may under≈øtand ≈øomething of the meaning of that, when they come to beg nothing but their own that was due to them, by plain Ju≈øtice, bare and thread-bare, and ≈øtark naked Ju≈øtice and Hone≈øty: Therefore if there be not ≈øome way to ≈øecure poor Seamen's <hi>Pay</hi> for time to come, it is pa≈øt my skill to warrant our Sea-Port Towns will ≈øend their Men, Children or Servants into the Service ≈øo freely as before; and it may be they that have been ≈øo ≈øerved, as afore≈øaid, if they are not dead, yet will not come without good words. And,</p>
            <p>41. Therefore if I might humbly pre≈øume to give my thought, I would ≈øuppo≈øe it requi≈øite not only to <hi>take all care imaginable to ≈øecure the Seamen's Lives, and Pay, and Health, but al≈øo to have the Act for their Encouragement read in every Ship once a quarter, and an Ab≈øtract of the Encouragement ≈øet up in the Sea-Port Towns of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>or at lea≈øt the Heads of it put in the</hi> Gazette, <hi>that the Nation may ≈øee, for time to come, that they do not pay their many, and the Seamen ruined; but that the Seamen ≈øhall be encouraged, and al≈øo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>42. That they might be paid in <hi>London,</hi> that the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that is always ready to a≈ø≈øi≈øt his Maje≈øty with money, may have ≈øome again from the Seamen; and not let tho≈øe who <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> the Seamen, put the King to extraordinary charge to pay the Seamen ≈øeveral miles off, to the depriving the City of their Trade, and the ≈øpoiling of near half the Seamens Pay be≈øides; For in ≈øhort, in <hi>London</hi> the Seamen can buy all things at be≈øt hand, can ≈øend home their mony to their Families, to any part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Scotland;</hi> And if they but ≈øpend their mony here, or ≈øend it home to their Families, and injoy a months Liberty, and fre≈øh Air, and fre≈øh Victuals, the Sea will be the next thing they will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55757:20"/>be for; And Seamen will live and increa≈øe, as in other Ages of the World they u≈øed to do in times of War, altho Thou≈øands were kill'd: And of the mo≈øt fighting War the Seamen ever ≈øaw in <hi>England</hi> this 100 Years, it can only be ≈øaid, the Sword or Guns kill'd Thou≈øands. But this War, without fighting, hath been the Death of <hi>≈øeveral Ten Thou≈øands.</hi> And indeed this makes me think of their Complaints to me, ≈øome years pa≈øt, that they could not Fight it out, as in former Ages: And indeed, in my mind, the Fighting like Men, and being Kill'd an Hundred in a Ship, is nothing; ≈øuch a lo≈øs to them≈øelves, their Families, the King, and the Nation, as being kept on Board of Ship, until three or four Hundred in a Ship Die before the Voyage is done, and ≈øometimes a quarter of their Men Sick together; and how melancholly that mu≈øt be, and at la≈øt be ≈øerv'd as the <hi>Mary</hi>'s Men that brought home about forty of tho≈øe Men they carried out, and Buried about ≈øix or ≈øeven Hundred Men, and the≈øe forty men not ≈øuffered to have a Penny of Money one Shore to Refre≈øh them≈øelves, and tell their Friends that ≈øome e≈øcaped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. I am afraid that ≈øome hard Hearted wretches makes as if our Seamen's Mi≈øeries were a Comedy, but God knows whether the next Age will not call it a Tragedy, ≈øeeing ≈øuch dreadful Numbers of Lives have been lo≈øt; but however it be, His Maje≈øty and the Parliament may now inquire of the Actors; how it is, and why it was ≈øo contriv'd, and the Charge of the whole ≈øeem ≈øo great, and ≈øhew no better; but my Wits run a Wool-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering: in≈øtead of Writing a few Heads I make ≈øo great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they will require an Hour's time to undre≈øs by the Fire-≈øide at Night before Bed-time, and the Di≈øcour≈øe may ≈øeem te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious: But if ≈øo, how tedious mu≈øt that mi≈øery be, when it may be a few Lives Repre≈øent forty Thou≈øand Mi≈øeries; and I would have put in a pretty deal of Di≈øcour≈øe of Knavery al≈øo, as how, it may be, the King and Country may be Cheated ≈øhamefully: But if it be to be heard only at the <hi>Navy-Office</hi> or <hi>Admiralty-Office,</hi> as one great Cheat was, that I went about la≈øt Year, and Forger of Powers. And another that I went to the Commi≈ø≈øioners that Stated the Publick Accounts this year, about; but they having not lei≈øure, I ≈øuppo≈øe the partie's peace was made up another way. But I would have had the method of Cheating to be found out above, and prevented by Law for time
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55757:20"/>to come, for the advantage of the King and the Country; for I ≈øuppo≈øe there hath been ≈øo many Informations of the King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheated, and the Seamen cheated, that have been brought before the Admiralty and Navy-board, that they know the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Knavery ten times more than I; and it may be as <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Coals to Newca≈øtle,</hi> to tell them. But I wonder they have not made an out-cry to the Parliament again≈øt all the cheating and Knavery they have been inform'd of; for if their Skill be only in the Running and Ruining of Seamen out of their Pay when they are ≈øick or dead, I am ≈øorry; and e≈øpecially ≈øeeing I cannot find it weareth well, we have lo≈øt ≈øo much this Year, our Accounts will not come even, be≈øides the lo≈øs of the <hi>Hope,</hi> the <hi>Brave Hope:</hi> O that <hi>England</hi> ≈øhould lo≈øe their <hi>Hope</hi> at Sea to the <hi>French</hi> this Year. And now I think of the <hi>Hope,</hi> there was five Ships of the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> as I under≈øtand, and 2 went away, and 2 run away; and there was 5 Ships of the <hi>French,</hi> and they, like cunning Knaves, kept together, and ≈øo got away the <hi>Hope,</hi> tho ≈øhe fought well. And now our brave <hi>Soveraign</hi> is burned, which is to be lamented, and for that ≈øhe was ≈øo brave a Ship, and named the <hi>Soveraign;</hi> And as for the Vulgar Name, ≈øome call'd her <hi>the Sufferance;</hi> As to that Name, <hi>the Sufferance,</hi> if all the Seamen's Calamities be redre≈ø≈øed, I ≈øuppo≈øe they will never ≈øee ≈øuch a <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance</hi> again in ha≈øte. But I wi≈øh we may ≈øee a brave <hi>New Hope,</hi> and as good a Ship as the other, for our Gracious King to go on board of, and name her, <hi>The New Soveraign.</hi> And ≈øo much to that. But,</p>
            <p>43. It might be con≈øidered of, that ≈øeeing we have lo≈øt near 100 Ships of War the≈øe la≈øt 7 Years, to a prodigious charge to the Nation; And many people admire what is done with all the Mony rai≈øed, never con≈øidering, that ≈øince we ≈øaved our Ships from being lo≈øt by fighting at fir≈øt, we have lo≈øt and fool'd away near as many ≈øince as will co≈øt Two Millions of Mony to build more, be≈øides the Millions of Mony extraordinary to keep an heap of Ships always in pay, tho a great many of them ≈øeldom ≈øend word home what good they do abroad. And I have ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought it is po≈ø≈øible to act like boys in the ≈øtreet, that meet before <hi>Proce≈ø≈øioning-Days,</hi> great heaps and numbers, as if they would drive the Town before them; and, poor Wretches, it may be, not one in 6 hath the heart to ≈øtrike a ≈øtroke, only
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55757:21"/>run about and dirt their clothes, and put their parents to charge. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>As to our Ships lo≈øt; for time to come, it may be u≈øeful for the Commi≈ø≈øioners that ≈øtate the publick. Accounts, to have the ca≈øe of our Ships lo≈øt, brought before them, that if any body be in fault, they may not be all excu≈øed. And indeed, ≈øo long as the Seamen are ≈øent away in other Ships, and the Commanders are their own Accu≈øers, and their Friends the Judges, they will do well enough. I have ≈øometimes thought how mi≈øchievous a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>No Body</hi> is grown ≈øince I was a Child; Then he u≈øed to be accu≈øed for ≈øtealing Apples, and eating up odd things, or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Wine or Strong Drink in a hou≈øe; but now, if there be Ships murdered, or fool'd away, or betray'd to the Enemies, or Fleets mi≈øcarry, as bad as our <hi>Smirna</hi> Fleet, <hi>No Body</hi> is mo≈øt times called to Account, and puni≈øhed for the ≈øame: And when as the Seamen of <hi>England</hi> are ruined and de≈øtroyed, and dead, or frighted out of the Service of our Gracious King <hi>William,</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them, and then ≈øtill <hi>No Body</hi> mu≈øt be blamed and ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the ≈øame. And indeed, had not our mo≈øt Gracious King <hi>William</hi> ≈øpoken for them, and the Loyal Parliament e≈øpou≈øed their Cau≈øe, to relieve them, no body would perhaps have regarded their Ruin and De≈øtruction ≈øo long until they and their Families might have been ≈øome of the mo≈øt mi≈øerable ruined Creatures on the Face of the Earth, and no body would have gotten by their Ruin in this Nation; And yet it may be no body would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered that they had been ≈øome of them like the poor men that travelled from <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> to <hi>Jerico,</hi> and fell among Thieves, who did not only rob them, and wound them, but did actually leave them half dead; And yet I ≈øuppo≈øe no body will be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at la≈øt for all this Ruin and de≈øtruction of them and their Families, altho it may be the next Age will cry out ≈øhame of it, and ≈øay, the blame mu≈øt lie ≈øomewhere: And it may be they will inquire then, who were tho≈øe at the Admiralty, or Navy-board, or in any other places, that directed and managed our Sea-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in tho≈øe days wherein the Seamen of <hi>England</hi> were more ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined than ever the World ≈øaw, and more Men of War and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Ships lo≈øt than ever the Sea groaned under, in ≈øo few Years of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Concerns; and if they under≈øtand the true Hi≈øtory of this Age, they mu≈øt know that our Gracious King <hi>William</hi> is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55757:21"/>the Ju≈øte≈øt and Mercifulle≈øt King in the World; but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the <hi>management of the whole Confederacy again≈øt that common plague of the Chri≈øtian World,</hi> the <hi>French King;</hi> And is forced to be be <hi>abroad,</hi> beyond Sea every Summer, to manage the Army; And that it will be known that he left the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sea-Affairs unto <hi>Engli≈øhmen,</hi> and that to ≈øuch as are qualified by Law; and if there be any that wanteth any Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Grace, or Rea≈øon, or Common Sen≈øe, or Common Hone≈øty or Loyalty to him, it ≈øhould be be≈øt known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; for I do not meddle with Names of Men; but the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Seamen ≈øtick in my ≈øtomach, and I cannot dige≈øt it; for I am ≈øick of it; and had I been a Merchant, it may be I ≈øhould have been ≈øick of our Ships and Merchandize al≈øo. But howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it may be ob≈øerved, That whatever mi≈øeries or ruines come in the <hi>management of things,</hi> there is this to be con≈øidered of; The <hi>Managers</hi> of it mu≈øt be men truly qualified; and that is ≈øomething. But I wi≈øh, for time to come, there may be men qualified with Grace, and Wi≈ødom, and Loyalty to the pre≈øent Government, and that may have an intire Love to his Maje≈øty, and the good old <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Intere≈øt, that we may not be, any of the inhabitants of the≈øe Nations, forced to roar like Bears, or to mourn ≈øore, like Doves. But <hi>I</hi> had forgot going on concerning particular incouragement for Seamen; as that they,</p>
            <p>44. Might never have ≈øowr Beveridge Wine forced on them in the <hi>Straits,</hi> that One Hog≈øhead will mix with 12 Hog≈øheads of Water; as is ≈øometimes done in the <hi>Streights,</hi> for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Pur≈øers, tho to the hazard of Seamens Health or Lives.</p>
            <p>45. And that all Seamen might be incouraged to look out for their Enemies Ships, and that they that did ≈øpy them fir≈øt, might be rewarded; And they that entred the Ships on board that are taken, might have incouragement, and not to be forced to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver every little thing they get to their Lieutenants, or Officers; And al≈øo it were well if there were given an Account at the Prize-Office, of the Value of Mony that hath been paid to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men this. War, to ≈øee if they have had any thing to ≈øpeak of, or whether the Officers got all to them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>46. And that no Officer, on pre≈ø≈øing, do take any Bribes in pre≈ø≈øing, to exen≈øe the Able Seamen, and in the mean time take
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55757:22"/>Boys, and infirm per≈øons, or Landmen for the Service of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty; And that all Pre≈øs-Katche's Accounts be examined for time to come, to ≈øee if they do not put the King to 30 or 40 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> charge to pre≈øs 2 or 3 men; And that no Katches bring Coals for the Officers, from <hi>Newca≈øtle,</hi> in≈øtead of Seamen for the King.</p>
            <p>47. That if Ships are in Harbour, the Pur≈øer to give the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men their Allowance, as much as po≈ø≈øible, in fre≈øh provi≈øion, it being all on charge to his <hi>Maje≈øty;</hi> and the way for Seamen to recover of the Scurvy, or other Sea-Di≈øtempers.</p>
            <p>48. That when the Seamen have been fed in the Winter, and clothed in <hi>London,</hi> and they that have Families been ≈øupported a Year or 2 on Credit, they may not be extorted on at <hi>Chatham,</hi> or <hi>Deal,</hi> or <hi>Port≈ømouth,</hi> to run in debt 18 or 20 <abbr>

And that in ca≈øe at any of tho≈øe Sea-Port Towns they do tru≈øt them above that ≈øum, except in ≈øickne≈øs; or if they lodge there 10 <abbr>s</abbr> the week, to prevent many thou≈øands of Seamen running out of the Land; and that many mu≈øt do, or hide when the War is over; For where there is a Seaman owes 30 <abbr>

And now in time of War, the Pari≈øhes near <hi>London,</hi> are forced to relieve many Families of tho≈øe who ≈øo ba≈øely ≈øpend their mony in the Sea-Port Towns; And his Maje≈øty's Service is often <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>52. That the Ma≈øters who ≈øtop 2 or 3 months pay a piece from the Seamen, when they pay them, unju≈øtly, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed as Villains, that do go the way to di≈øcourage, and bring a Cur≈øe on our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Navigation, if it lay in their power. Whereas tho≈øe hone≈øt Ma≈øters, that Victual well, and pay well, are ≈øuch as go the way to incourage our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Navigation, and to procure a ble≈ø≈øing on the ≈øame; and the≈øe Ma≈øters I love; but I hate all ≈øorts of Villany and Knavery wherever I meet with it in any: And do therefore expect to hear of ≈øome Knaves find Fault with this, as ≈øome Thieves and Cheats did when they heard I did di≈øcover to the Parliament how the King and Nation was cheated. But I wonder they ≈øhould be ≈øuch Fools to complain,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55757:23"/>≈øeeing I named no body; And if they had laughed at it, no body had need to have known they had been guilty them≈øelves: And ≈øo I wi≈øh them to be wi≈øer next time; And tho there are Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cheats and Villains to Cheat the King and Country, I know their methods, and am a≈øhamed that ≈øo brave and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a King, and ≈øo famous and fine a Country, and ≈øuch Stout, Loyal, brave Seamen, the be≈øt in the Univer≈øal World, ≈øhould be all cheated and abu≈øed, and that many times by tho≈øe who drink it away, or whore it away, or game it away. Again, and if one Devil helps them to get it, there is ≈øo many Devils to help to ≈øpend it, that ≈øome of them will not be worth one Groat a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, in a Years time after the War is over, and nothing ≈øtirring but Hone≈øty and Indu≈øtry.</p>
            <p>But 53. There ought to be ≈øome care taken that Ma≈øters of Ships might not abu≈øe, and cheat, and beat, and ≈øtarve their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beyond Sea; for that hath cau≈øed multitudes of <hi>Engli≈øhmen</hi> to run away in the <hi>Straits,</hi> and other Voyages, to the great di≈øcouragement of our brave <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Seamen, who will do any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if incouraged; but will be mad, and run away to ≈øerve any Nation, yea even the <hi>Turks</hi> them≈øelves, if they are Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed.</p>
            <p>54. It is pity there is not more liberal incouragement for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to carry Ventures, and to be extraordinary well provided with provi≈øions in their Voyages to the <hi>Ea≈øt Indies,</hi> ≈øince many Ships have in that Voyage, of tho≈øe they carried out, buried 4 men to One of tho≈øe which they did bring home: And that is bad, to lo≈øe all to a fifth part. And many men have in that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age been ≈øuppo≈øed to die for want. And the Company ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by it in the danger of their Goods, if Ships mi≈øcarry. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as tho≈øe Brave Worthy Commanders, who Victual extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and take great care of their men, do come home well, and their men love them, and I love them al≈øo for their Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty and love to the Seamen. But it is a ≈øhame that any Ship's Commanders ≈øhould be ≈øo unnatural as to want water almo≈øt ≈øo ≈øoon as they come out of the Harbour: And if there were a Law made, That all Seamen in Merchant Ships ≈øhould be paid the full for their ≈øhort Allowance and Water-mony, as the King doth; And that would be the Way to incourage the Seamen to keep their Ships, and not run away to ≈øerve other Nations for want
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55757:23"/>of better u≈øage. And the Commanders of all Ships, for time to come, ought at lea≈øt to be made to provide Water for their Ship's Company, and not neglect it, or fraught their Ships ≈øo full that they have no room for Water, that ≈øo the poor Seamen may not be whipt at the Geers for drinking the Water that is allow'd for the Hogs. This ≈øeems to be wor≈øe than the poor prodigal Son was ≈øerved: And indeed I have ob≈øerved, That the <hi>Interlopers</hi> Ships to <hi>India,</hi> that their men had liberty to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Ventures, have gone well, and their men come home as fat as Pigs almo≈øt; as if they had not only had enough of Water, but had eaten half the Hogs al≈øo. And indeed it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo,</p>
            <p>55. Great pity that ≈øo many poor mi≈øerable people were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to come and wait, and wait and come 20 times for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny after it is due, for 4 months pay, at the <hi>Ea≈øt India-Hou≈øe.</hi> The lo≈øs of time to many, and their labour, and waiting ≈øometimes 3 or 4 hours in a day, is worth to ≈øome, I fear, if they reckon their Time, above half the mony. But this Age ≈øeems to play with mi≈øery. I meet with ≈øo many Objects of this Age's being hardned again≈øt the Groans of the poor, in ≈øome places, and Cries of the Poor, that truly I mu≈øt needs fear that the mo≈øt merciful God will ari≈øe to plead the Cau≈øe of the Poor, the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, the Fatherle≈øs and the Widow, ≈øeeing many men ≈øeem to lo≈øe moral pity. And indeed I am afraid it is gone to look after moral hone≈øty, many mens very Con≈øciences ≈øeeming to be even as it is ≈øaid of ≈øome Fire-Locks, Ca≈øe-hardened: And as it is ≈øaid, <hi>That a good man is merciful to his bea≈øt;</hi> ≈øo I will ≈øay, that even the tender mercies of many wicked men in this Age, are cruel. But certainly God did not ≈øend men into this World to be like Devils, to plague and afflict mankind. And therefore it were well and convenient;</p>
            <p>56. That no Seamen in any Merchant Ship whatever, to be forced to wait above four Weeks after the Ship is in Harbour, for their Money, it being a very great oppre≈ø≈øion on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, after a long and tedious Voyage, to have no Mony to buy any thing for them≈øelves or Families in three Months time, and thereby Live on Credit, take up their Cloaths and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, at what Prices any will ≈øet on them, to the great Lo≈øs of many Families.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55757:24"/>
            <p>57. But if there were a Law made for the Hearing of the Seamen's being abus'd or cheated of their Pay; and either the Ma≈øters of the <hi>Trinity-Hou≈øe,</hi> or ≈øome other men, to be as a Court of Con≈øcience to hear the Seamen's Cau≈øe, without Charge, it would ≈øave the poor Seamen's being forc'd to go to Law for their Wages after any Voyage, or for mony to be paid in the time of any Voyage, it might ≈øave a multitude of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at Law, or lo≈øs to poor mi≈øerable Seamen, or their Families being often forc'd to give one half to get the other Recovered, after it is Earn'd.</p>
            <p>58. Another method for the true management of our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Navigation, is to labour to have both the Commanders and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Seamen, to be brought to a moral Reformation, and al≈øo to a Religious Wor≈øhip, and fear of the God of Heaven and Earth, and Sea, at who≈øe Command are both Winds and Seas, and indeed if God be not ≈øought unto, but in≈øtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, dayly Bla≈øphemed all other ways and means will be too ≈øhort to Expect a real Ble≈ø≈øing, and comfortable Incouragement, as we might wi≈øh; but that the Seamen will be ≈øo much oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Ships Ruined and Spoiled, more and more, until there be ≈øome outward Reformation at lea≈øt, if not a true and ≈øound Reformation of Life and Manners. And if the general in≈øtructions printed and given to the Captains and Lieutenants of Ships by the Admiralty, were minded aright, it would mend many things, and therefore de≈øerves to be inquired into, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the method of the Well-Government of our Ships and men; And the fir≈øt Paragraph of it is, <hi>That God be duly wor≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and that twice a day, and all Profanene≈øs, Drunkenne≈øs, Swearing and Cur≈øing be di≈øcountenanced and puni≈øhed; and the Commanders that allow it, turned out.</hi> And we ≈øhould meet the Lord by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance both by Sea and Land; and cry to the Lord, that he would meet us with his mercy, that we may, by Righteou≈øne≈øs, be an exalted Nation, and not for our ≈øins be a ruined people: And therefore,</p>
            <p>59. It were well if every Ship in <hi>England</hi> that carrieth but ten men were bound to carry that excellent Book of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Doctrine, the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> to read 2 <hi>Homilies</hi> every <hi>Sunday.</hi> And it hath the 39 Articles bound up with it, that all Seafaring men might ≈øee the excellent Doctrine of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55757:24"/>Old Church of <hi>England</hi> to be for ≈øound Piety and Holine≈øs: And that it may be ≈øaid of the Prophanene≈øs of this Age, That it is ≈øuch a thing as the Fundamental Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> abhors: And as it was ≈øaid of Old, of ≈øome that knew not <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> ≈øo it may be ≈øaid of the great Wickedne≈øs of this Age, That it is from ≈øuch as know not God, neither do they truly know, and believe, and practice that true fundamental Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> And it were well if the Reverend Bi≈øhops would con≈øult the great need there is of ≈øuch Laws as may in ≈øome mea≈øure at lea≈øt bring men to as near a Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the ≈øub≈øtantial, Fundamental Holine≈øs, Sobriety, Charity, Ju≈øtice, and all Chri≈øtian, Fundamental Duties of Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs that are contained in ≈øo holy a Doctrine.</p>
            <p>60. And that every Ship that doth carry 120 men, or more, do carry an able, ≈øober Mini≈øter, to in≈øtruct the Seamen in their Duty towards God, and to reprove the Vices of any one in the Ship; And by their Doctrine and Conver≈øation, to ≈øhew to them that the fundamental Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is for the Real Service of God and Holine≈øs, and again≈øt all ≈øin; And that they that profe≈øs the Doctrine, and live in Wickedne≈øs, are fal≈øe pretenders to ≈øo holy Doctrine.</p>
            <p>61. And therefore that Excellent Act again≈øt Cur≈øing and Swearing, if well executed, will be a good beginning, and a good help towards a moral Reformation. So if the great Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Age could be ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, it would be a good help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men's coming to con≈øider of a future ≈øtate, and to think, that whatever they are them≈øelves at pre≈øent, yet mankind was created to live to the Glory of God, and to honour him; and not to live like bea≈øts, and wor≈øe than bea≈øts. And the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent the fundamental Doctrine of Chri≈øtianity is in any Church or Nation, the greater the condemnation of tho≈øe mu≈øt be that do ≈øin again≈øt the Light of the ≈øame, and will not regard to walk according unto it.</p>
            <p>And now having ≈øaid this, I will return again to another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement I think there is great need of, altho the Seamen in all <hi>Merchant</hi> Ships, that go well and come well, in the <hi>Merchant's</hi> ≈øervice, pay ≈øomething towards the ≈øame; And that is,</p>
            <p>62. That all Fleets of Merchant Ships ≈øhould, as much as po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, keep company, and ≈øtand by one the other, except much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powered;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55757:25"/>And for want of this there was 6 or 7 Ships ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of 12 in One Fleet, by 2 <hi>Privateers.</hi> Therefore tho≈øe Ships that would not fight, the <hi>Commanders</hi> ought to be made publick Examples.</p>
            <p>63. And tho≈øe that fight ≈øtoutly, as brave <hi>Engli≈øhmen,</hi> to be incouraged and preferred.</p>
            <p>64. And that tho≈øe Seamen that lo≈øe their Lives or Limbs in <hi>Merchant</hi> ≈øhips, ≈øhould be incouraged, and have Bounty-mony, as in his Maje≈øties ≈øervice they that are Wounded or Kill'd there have.</p>
            <p>But now I would not be mi≈øtaken, to think that his Maje≈øty ≈øhould pay it; altho if a <hi>Merchant</hi> Ship be lo≈øt, it may fall out that his Maje≈øty may lo≈øe 4000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> Cu≈øtom: And were it ≈øo they did fight and ≈øave the Ship and Goods, if there were 20 kill'd, and 10 wounded, if his Maje≈øty paid each of them, or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> it were 200 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> and his Maje≈øty would ≈øave 3600 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> by the ≈øaving the Ship at la≈øt, and the Merchants, it may be, 30000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> by the bargain al≈øo: And therefore it would be of great u≈øe to the King and to the Merchants, and to the Nation in general, to ≈øave our Ships as much as po≈ø≈øible, and ruin our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies as much as po≈ø≈øible, and encourage our Seamen and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters to fight, to ≈øave the Ships as much as po≈ø≈øible. But I have often wondred that any Merchants ≈øhould be ≈øo barbarous, or Ma≈øters ≈øo uncharitable, as not to give the Seamens Families one penny of Eucouragement, who laid down their Lives, and ≈øaved their Ships. And ≈øometimes I have heard of ≈øome that have been forc'd to go to Law for their Wages after the Ship was ≈øaved<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> And as I remember, a Cu≈øtomer of mine was forced to pay the Chirurgeon 3 or 4 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> to cure him of his Wounds. Now I did look on this <hi>as barbarous:</hi> And I do ≈øay, in this re≈øpect, the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> is much better than the <hi>Merchant-men;</hi> And would be in many others al≈øo, if it were not for the Fault of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and Officers of divers ≈øorts. But this by the way; for I think we ≈øhould be the mo≈øt <hi>happy people under the Face of Heaven,</hi> if it were not for the Sins, and Follies, and Bribery, and Knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Villany of the Age we live in; Whereby men are Ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and plagued and Afflicted more than ever, in ≈øeveral Kinds, both in <hi>Men of War and Merchant</hi> Ships, and the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lo≈øe by the ≈øame at la≈øt, many Seamen ≈øerving, as is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55757:25"/>other Nations, by being ≈øo much di≈øcouraged in their own: But I leave that, and would to God that all would indeed leave it in good earne≈øt, and ≈øet them≈øelves to ≈øtudy to ≈øerve God and his Maje≈øty, and the common good of all the≈øe Nations; and in order to it, I think this is one, to incourage all Seamen, as much as po≈ø≈øible, to pre≈øerve our Shipping; and one way was, that, as I ≈øaid, <hi>Whoever lo≈øt their Limbs or Lives in defending a Merchant Ship, ≈øhould have Pen≈øions, or Bounty-mony:</hi> And I ≈øuppo≈øe, that if there were a Law made, That every one ≈øhould be ≈øo rewarded, every Seaman would be more willing to venture their Lives to ≈øave their Ships: and the very Seamen in Merchant Ships, that went well and came well, would pay 12 <abbr>
                  <hi>d</hi>
               </abbr> out of every pound towards a Che≈øt to be kept for that purpo≈øe at <hi>Greenwich</hi> Ho≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as there is a Che≈øt for the Cripples at <hi>Chatham:</hi> And there might be a Commi≈ø≈øioner, or 2 or 3, appointed to manage it in time of War and Peace: And in time of War, they that are in Merchant Ships could afford to pay that cheerfully, becau≈øe their Wages is near double; and in time of Peace it might be but 6<abbr>d</abbr> in the pound towards the Pen≈øions; and a Clerk or 2 appointed at the ≈øaid Ho≈øpital, to keep all accounts of every mans months pay in <hi>England,</hi> and to receive the mony, and to pay it out again to the Widow or Aged Parents of all that are kill'd in the defence of Merchant Ships, 20<abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> and to all that lo≈øe a Limb, or the total u≈øe of a Limb, in the defence of a Merchant Ship, 6 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> the year during their Lives; for their Relief; and this to be paid them con≈øtantly: And not to have any Ticket-buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ≈øuffered to extort half of it from them: And if the ≈øaid ≈øhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the pound paid by others, did amount to more, as it might, if gathered faithfully all over the Nation, then the re≈øt to go to the Widows of poor Seamen, or to aged Seamen that were pa≈øt their labour. And it is as great pity, but all indu≈øtrious Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ≈øhould be incouraged in <hi>England,</hi> ≈øeeing I do not remember that ever in all my Life I heard of one Ship, either Merchant Man, or Man of War lo≈øt, becau≈øe the Seamen would not fight; but ≈øo many becau≈øe the Commanders would not fight, that I have been ofter grieved and a≈øhamed to hear of it. And if there were a Law made to incourage the Seamen, I wi≈øh there were al≈øo another, That if the Commander<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> would not fight, they ≈øhould lo≈øe, as afore≈øaid, 2 of their ≈øingers, and be ≈øold for

            <p>And now to ≈øay ≈øomething to ≈øave his Maje≈øty's mony, and the poor Seamens al≈øo, for time to come, I do ≈øuppo≈øe it will be needful for time to come, to make it Felony to commit the≈øe Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, <hi>viz.</hi>

But, <hi>Hone≈øty,</hi> it ≈øeems, knows not what Names to call tho≈øe by that Ruin the Living, and fright many of them away; and Run the Dead, and let their Families cry for Ju≈øtice or Vengeance; and he knows not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the next Age will call them barbarous Villains, or hard hearted Wretches, or Fools, or Knaves, or Jacobites, and Friends to <hi>French,</hi> or a mixture of all together, and Ruiners of their Country into the bargain.</p>

               <p>I will not ≈øay what they mu≈øt do, but I will ≈øay, if they be not prevented; they that plea≈øe to give their mind to it, and have Tickets at their command, I fear can get Powers fill'd up, and witne≈ø≈øed by them≈øelves, or other Officers, and leave Blanks for ≈øuch Names to receive them, as may ≈øerve to be put in afterwards: And therefore it was my Advice, That if the Parliament plea≈øed, they ≈øhould make it Felony and Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation to receive a Seaman's <hi>Pay</hi> by a wrong power, for time to come: And if they had been Seamen, and cheated of their <hi>Pay,</hi> ten times as often as men have Robbed on the High-way, or had their Pockets pickt at Land, they would have ≈øtriv'd to make a Law again≈øt cheating, for time tu come, and not left it to will and plea≈øure, to hinder ≈ømall Officers from receiving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by a Lawful Power, although they fed them and cloathed them ≈øeveral Years before, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them whsle they ≈øerved the King, and in the mean time leave ≈øo many ways open to cheat the King and the Seamen by other Officers ≈øtill in private ways, in≈øtead of tho≈øe Hundreds of Pounds in a Ship received for the Captains, of Seamens <hi>Pay</hi> publickly, in former Years.</p>

               <p>It is a Wonder that you will meddle with ≈øuch Di≈øea≈øes as are <hi>Noli me tangeries;</hi> that though they are heard of publickly now and then, as the <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> is in the <hi>Weekly Bill,</hi> yet hardly One in an Hundred knows what a dreadful Di≈øtemper it is, although ≈øome die of the ≈øame: And therefore, pray if you meet with any Offices that are infected

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>SInce I writ my fir≈øt book of the Seamens mi≈øeries, and pre≈øented 500 of them to the 2 mo≈øt Honourable Hou≈øes of Parliament, who were graciou≈øly plea≈øed to pa≈øs by my infirmities, in repre≈øenting the fame; for which I am in all humble duty obliged to be thankful to them. And I have pre≈øumed to attempt the foregoing rough Peice, being heartily willing any that can repre≈øent better Rules for the ≈øafety and encouragement of the Seamen, to ≈øerve his gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty King <hi>William,</hi> and the Nation, I ≈øhall rejoice. But if any ≈øay, ≈øome did by my other book, they could have repre≈øented it in fewer as words, and yet never had them≈øelves neither wit, or ≈øen≈øe, or heart for to repre≈øent it at all, I ≈øhall look on their words as idle prate, and to try their skill, if they are excellent at any thing, I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the mi≈øerable Ca≈øe of our Trading People, and the poor in the≈øe Nations, in re≈øpect of our mony, which I fear the lo≈øs of will be fatal to both: And I wi≈øh it may not be mi≈øerable in re≈øpect of the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing the Taxes for his Maje≈øty: for I fear that as our Mill'd Money was bought up to carry away, or melted down, above 20 years, when it was worth but a Groat in the pound to make it away; then I fear it will be ten times more in danger to be all melted down or carried away, or both, now it is worth ten Groats in the pound to make it away either way. Neither do I ≈øee how Trade≈ømen can e≈øcape Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for want of Trade, if there be not mony to Trade, and Exchange, and pay the poor. And the Lo≈øs of Trade already to ≈øome I fear hath been, and is like to be ten times wor≈øe than their Taxes; and unle≈øs there be a new Coinage, that is about 3 Ounces to 20 <abbr>s</abbr> or the Mill'd mony rai≈øed to 6 <abbr>s</abbr> and 8 <abbr>
                  <hi>d</hi>
               </abbr> the Crown Peice, I fear whoever lives 9 months, will ≈øee hardly any of it pa≈ø≈øing about; and for Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea's, they are at pre≈øent a perfect Plague and Trick to mankind, and a means for men to prey upon one another; and if they fall, will be carried away; but if ≈øetled at but 28 <abbr>
                  <hi>s</hi>
               </abbr> the Guinea certain, would pay in Taxes, and out again; and there might be One <hi>per Cent.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for profit of tho≈øe who carried Silver and Gold to Coin; and the re≈øt to go towards the Calling in the Fragments of our Old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at la≈øt; And there would never want Silver nor Coiners; and we ≈øhould be in a few Years full of mony, to the Joy of the King and Country, and Landlord and Tenant: And this I would repre≈øent,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55757:32"/>that our Seamen at Sea, and the common people at Land, tho called the <hi>Mobilly,</hi> have been entirely in the Intere≈øt of our gracious King <hi>William,</hi> and this Nation. And I fear our Enemies would rejoice it they could find the Ordinary people to be Ruined at Land for want of mony; and then they would ≈øay, as they begin already, <hi>Where is your mony?</hi> and I fear, if po≈ø≈øible, will make the wor≈øt u≈øe they could of the ≈øame. And, if I mi≈øtake not, our Ca≈øe in the Suburbs of <hi>London,</hi> is ≈øo bad already, that One may go to ten Trade≈ømen before One meet with a man can change a Guinea: So that here is Work for the Wits to <hi>propo≈øe a help</hi> that is pa≈øt my skill to think or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand how ever the <hi>common people</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ≈øhall keep Silver mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any more, if there be none but what is <hi>worth a great deal more to melt down, or carry away:</hi> They may ki≈øs it at parting, as Friends that do never expect to ≈øee One the Other more, I fear; and have not ≈øen≈øe to get over my fears, but re≈øt in them this 27th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 169<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
